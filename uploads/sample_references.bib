 abstract = {<jats:p>The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly in both developed and developing countries. Asia is developing as the epicentre of the escalating pandemic, reflecting rapid transitions in demography, migration, diet, and lifestyle patterns. The effective management of Type 2 diabetes in Asia may be complicated by differences in prevalence, risk factor profiles, genetic risk allele frequencies, and gene-environment interactions between different Asian countries, and between Asian and other continental populations. To reduce the worldwide burden of T2D, it will be important to understand the architecture of T2D susceptibility both within and between populations. This review will provide an overview of known genetic and nongenetic risk factors for T2D, placing the results from Asian studies in the context of broader global research. Given recent evidence from large-scale genetic studies of T2D, we place special emphasis on emerging knowledge about the genetic architecture of T2D and the potential contribution of genetic effects to population differences in risk.</jats:p>},

 abstract = {<jats:p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is escalating rapidly in Asian countries, with the rapid increase likely attributable to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Recent research suggests that common genetic risk variants contribute minimally to the rapidly rising prevalence. Rather, recent changes in dietary patterns and physical activity may be more important. This nested case-control study assessed the association and predictive utility of type 2 diabetes lifestyle risk factors in participants from Malaysia, an understudied Asian population with comparatively high disease prevalence. The study sample comprised 4077 participants from The Malaysian Cohort project and included sub-samples from the three major ancestral groups: Malay (n = 1323), Chinese (n = 1344) and Indian (n = 1410). Association of lifestyle factors with type 2 diabetes was assessed within and across ancestral groups using logistic regression. Predictive utility was quantified and compared between groups using the Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). In predictive models including age, gender, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, location, family history of diabetes and average sleep duration, the AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.85 across groups and was significantly higher in Chinese than Malays or Indians, likely reflecting anthropometric differences. This study suggests that obesity, advancing age, a family history of diabetes and living in a rural area are important drivers of the escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Malaysia.</jats:p>},

                <jats:p>Many Australian adults are not receiving timely or effective diabetes management to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes related complications. Integrated care, a worldwide trend in healthcare reform, aims to reduce the fragmented delivery of health services and improve outcomes.

                <jats:p>Seventy-two general practice sites (clusters) in New South Wales, Australia received the Diabetes Alliance intervention, creating a non-randomised open cohort stepped wedge trial. The intervention comprised of case conferencing, delivered directly to a small proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1,072) of the general practice sites; as well as practice feedback, education and training. Spillover clinical improvements were assessed on all adults with type 2 diabetes within the general practice sites (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 22,706), using practice level data recorded in the MedicineInsight electronic database, compared before and after the intervention.

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Medication errors are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Clinical pharmacy services provided in hospital can reduce medication errors and medication related harm. However, few rural or remote hospitals in Australia have a clinical pharmacy service. This study will evaluate a virtual clinical pharmacy service (VCPS) provided via telehealth to eight rural and remote hospitals in NSW, Australia.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design will use routinely collected data from patients’ electronic medical records (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 2080) to evaluate the VCPS at eight facilities. The sequence of steps is randomised, allowing for control of potential confounding temporal trends. Primary outcomes are number of medication reconciliations completed on admission and discharge. Secondary outcomes are length of stay, falls and 28 day readmissions. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) will be conducted. The CEA will answer the question of whether the VCPS is more cost-effective compared to treatment as usual; the CBA will consider the rate of return on investing in the VCPS. A patient experience measure (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 500) and medication adherence questionnaire (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 100 pre and post) will also be used to identify patient responses to the virtual service. Focus groups will investigate implementation from hospital staff perspectives at each site.</jats:p>
<jats:p>Analyses of routine data will comprise generalised linear mixed models. Descriptive statistical analysis will summarise patient experience responses. Differences in medication adherence will be compared using linear regression models. Thematic analysis of focus groups will identify barriers and facilitators to VCPS implementation.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>
<jats:p>We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of virtual pharmacy interventions for rural populations, and inform best practice for using virtual healthcare to improve access to pharmacy services. It is widely recognised that clinical pharmacists are best placed to reduce medication errors. However, pharmacy services are limited in rural and remote hospitals. This project will provide evidence about ways in which the benefits of hospital pharmacists can be maximised utilising telehealth technology. If successful, this project can provide a model for pharmacy delivery in rural and remote locations.</jats:p>

Fourteen studies (six randomized controlled trials, eight cohorts) involving 2,918 patients met the eligibility criteria (with a total of 13 meeting criteria for the meta-analysis).

This study aimed to assess the types of self-exempting beliefs reported by a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, and identify associations between these beliefs and other smoking-related factors with quit intentions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March–December 2012 with smokers seeking welfare assistance in New South Wales (NSW), Australia (n = 354; response rate 79%). Responses to a 16-item self-exempting beliefs scale and intention to quit, smoker identity, and enjoyment of smoking were assessed. Most participants earned &lt;AUD$400/week (70%), and had not completed secondary schooling (64%). All “jungle” beliefs (normalising the dangers of smoking due to ubiquity of risk) and selected “skeptic” beliefs were endorsed by 25%–47% of the sample, indicating these smokers may not fully understand the extensive risks associated with smoking. Smokers with limited quit intentions held significantly stronger self-exempting beliefs than those contemplating or preparing to quit (all p &lt; 0.01). After adjusting for smoking-related variables only “skeptic” beliefs were significantly associated with intention to quit (p = 0.02). Some of these beliefs are incorrect and could be addressed in anti-smoking campaigns.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>Physical and mental health risks often commence during young adulthood. Vocational education institutions are an ideal setting for understanding how health-risks cluster together in students to develop holistic multiple health-risk interventions. This is the first study to examine clustering of tobacco smoking, fruit intake, vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, overweight/obesity, depression, and anxiety in vocational education students and the socio-demographic characteristics associated with cluster membership. A cross-sectional survey with vocational education students (n = 1134, mean age = 24.3 years) in New South Wales, Australia. Latent class analysis identified clusters and latent class regression examined characteristics associated with clusters. Four clusters were identified. All clusters had moderate inadequate fruit intake and moderate overweight/obesity. Cluster 1 (13% of sample) had “high anxiety, high inadequate vegetable intake, low tobacco, and low alcohol use.” Cluster 2 (16% of sample) had “high tobacco smoking, high alcohol use, high anxiety, high depression, and high inadequate vegetable intake.” Cluster 3 (52% of sample) had “high risky alcohol use, high inadequate vegetable intake, low depression, low anxiety, low tobacco smoking, and low physical inactivity.” Cluster 4 (19% of sample) was a “lower risk cluster with high inadequate vegetable intake.” Compared to cluster 4, 16–25-year-olds and those experiencing financial stress were more likely to belong to clusters 1, 2, and 3. Interventions for vocational education students should address fruit and vegetable intake and overweight/obesity and recognize that tobacco use and risky alcohol use sometimes occurs in the context of mental health issues.</jats:p>},

 abstract = {<jats:p>The adoption of dietary patterns emphasising higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods (plant-based diets, PBDs), continue to rise worldwide. PBDs have been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as major risk factors such as overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Evidence regarding the dietary profile and disease risk associated with various PBDs in comparison to traditional meat-eating diets are scarce within the Australian population. The aim of this study is to investigate the 5-year and 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) among Australians habitually following various PBDs compared to a regular meat diet (RMD). The Plant-based Diet (PBD) Study is a cross-sectional study consisting of healthy adults between aged 30-75 years from the Hunter Region (NSW) between 2021-2023. A validated FFQ was used to assess eligibility and categorise individuals who were habitually consuming one of five dietary patterns for at least 6 months into the following groups: vegan (nil animal products), lacto-vegetarian (LOV, including eggs and dairy), pesco-vegetarian (PV, including seafood with/without dairy and eggs), semi-vegetarian (SV, minimal consumption of animal products) or RMDs (including animal meat daily or multiple times/day)<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup>. 5-year and 10-year CVD risk was quantified using the Framingham Risk Equation<jats:sup>(2)</jats:sup> and the Australian Absolute CVD risk calculator, respectively. CVD risk and other quantitative measures was compared using One-way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis, and Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact for qualitative data. Directed acyclic graphs displayed confounding variables and mediators and a regression model was used to adjust for these. A total of 240 participants (median age 55(16), 77.5% female) with 48 participants in each group showed a significant difference in predicted 5-year risk of CVD (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05), however 10-year risk did not significantly differ across groups. 5-year CVD risk was significantly lower in the vegan group (1%) compared to the RMD, SV, PV, and LOV diet groups (all 2%). In comparison to a vegan diet, crude association showed those consuming a RMD had a 2.4% (95% CI 0.7, 4.1) higher 5-year risk of developing CVD, followed by 1.7% in LOV (95% CI 0.6, 2.9), 1.8% in PV (95% CI 0.5, 3), and 1.1% in SV (95% CI 0.2, 2.1). Significance was lost after adjusting for confounders such as age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity levels and BMI. This is the first study to purposefully sample Australians habitually following PBD, presenting novel population-based evidence for CVD risk. These findings suggest more restrictive PBDs such as vegan diets when compared to RMD may lead to lower CVD risk, however population-based longitudinal studies primary investigating the development of CVDs in the context of PBDs are warranted.</jats:p>},

            <jats:title>Subjects/methods</jats:title>
            <jats:p>A cross-sectional study of adults (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 240) aged 30–75 yrs, habitually following dietary patterns for ≥6 months; vegan, lacto-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian or regular meat-eater (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 48 per group).

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Compared to regular meat-eaters, vegans and lacto-ovo vegetarians had significantly lower intakes of protein (4-5 EN%), saturated fat (2-4 EN%), trans fat, cholesterol, vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>, iodine, riboflavin, niacin, sodium, and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA), and higher carbohydrate (5-7 EN%), fibre, vitamin E, folate, magnesium, iron, and n-6PUFA, whereas, pesco-vegetarians and semi-vegetarians had intermediate intakes. Individuals following PBDs consumed significantly more daily serves of vegetables (1–1.5 serves), fruit (1 serve, vegan only), legumes/nuts (0.5–1 serves), and less discretionary choices (0.5–1 serves) compared to regular meat-eaters. All dietary patterns were adequate in protein, exceeded in fat, inadequate in carbohydrate and met recommended serves of fruit and vegetables, but not grains. Inadequate serves were observed for meat/poultry/eggs/beans/nuts among PBDs except pesco-vegetarians, and dairy among semi-vegetarians and regular meat-eaters. Vegans and lacto-vegetarians were inadequate in vitamin B12, LCn-3PUFA, iodine, and in addition calcium among vegans, iodine in pesco-vegetarians, and LCn-3PUFA in semi-vegetarians and regular meat-eaters.</jats:p>

        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background </jats:bold>While a reduction in the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has slowed, newer strategies are needed to achieve an ongoing and sustainable reduction of the MMR. Previous studies have investigated the association between health system-related factors such as wealth inequalities, healthcare access and use on maternal mortality. However, a women’s rights-based approach to address MMR has not been studied, excluding the health system-related factors. This study aimed to analyse the association between gender equality and MMR globally.<jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold>Using structural equation modelling (SEM), secondary and open access data from the United Nations and other international agencies from 193 countries were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Gender-sensitive variables that represented the theoretical, conceptual framework of the study were selected. The association between latent variable gender equality and the outcome, MMR, was examined in the SEM. A second SEM model (n=158) was designed to include two variables related to gender-based violence.<jats:bold>Findings </jats:bold>Out of 521 gender-sensitive variables, we used 11 variables to estimate two models in SEM (Goodness of Fit Index=0‧929 for Model 1 and 0‧939 for Model 2). The latent variable, gender equality, was negatively associated with MMR (p&lt;0‧001, Z=–6‧96, 95% CI: –6508.98 to –3141.89 for Model 1 and p&lt;0‧001, Z=–7‧23, 95% CI: –6045.356 to –3467.515 for Model 2).<jats:bold>Interpretation </jats:bold>Gender equality was significantly associated with maternal mortality. Investing in higher education for women, improving their paid employment opportunities, increasing participation in leadership roles and politics, reducing intimate partner violence (IPV) and ending child marriage can significantly reduce maternal mortality.</jats:p>},

This secondary analysis explored the effects of past sexual (SA) and physical (PA) assault on depression, alcohol misuse, global functioning and attrition in the Depression and Alcohol Integrated and Single focussed Intervention (DAISI) project, whose participants (N = 278) received cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for their depression and/or alcohol misuse. Of the 278 DAISI participants, 220 consented to screening for past assault (either by a stranger or non-stranger) at baseline. Depression, alcohol, and global functioning assessments were administered at baseline and 3, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. A between-group analysis was used to assess differences between SA and No SA, and PA and No PA groupings, on adjusted mean treatment outcomes across all assessment periods. SA and PA participants had similar mean symptom reductions compared to No SA and No PA participants except for lower depression and global functioning change scores at the 12-month follow-up. People with coexisting depression and alcohol misuse reporting SA or PA can respond well to CBT for depression and alcohol misuse. However, follow-up is recommended in order to monitor fluctuations in outcomes.</jats:p>},

 abstract = {<jats:p>This study aimed to compare the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) among Australian women following plant-based diets (PBD) compared to regular meat eaters. A cross sectional analysis of the mid-aged cohort (1946–1951) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health was conducted on completers of Survey 7 in 2013 with complete FFQ data available (n = 9102). Dietary patterns were categorized as PBD (vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian) and regular meat eaters. Meat eaters were further categorized into high and low consumption and outcomes included self-reported prevalence of IGT and DM. Participants were identified as regular meat eaters (n = 8937) and PBD (n = 175). Prevalence of IGT was lower in PBD (0–1.2%) compared to regular meat eaters (9.1%). Consolidation of PBD to a single group (vegetarians) indicated a lower prevalence of DM in vegetarians compared to regular meat eaters (3.9% vs. 9.1%). Women consuming meat daily/multiple times per day had significantly higher odds of IGT (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1 to 2.1, p = 0.02). Individuals consuming processed meat daily/multiple times per day had significantly higher odds of DM compared to those consuming less than daily (Odds ratio (OR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.3, p &lt; 0.0001). After adjustment for covariates, statistical significance was lost largely due to the addition of BMI to the model. Prevalence of IGT and DM were lower in women following PBD and higher in high consumers of meat and processed meat. The relationship between meat consumption and IGT/diabetes status appears to be mediated, at least in part, by an increase in body mass index (BMI). Future studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms and other lifestyle factors underpinning the association between high meat consumption and increased risk of IGT and DM.</jats:p>},

This intervention includes webinar training for health professionals, an educational resources package for health professionals and pregnant women, free oral nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for pregnant women, and audit and feedback on health professionals' performance.</jats:p><jats:p>The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy intervention to improve health professionals' provision of evidence-based culturally responsive smoking cessation care to Australian Indigenous pregnant smokers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and analysis</jats:title><jats:p>This protocol describes the design of a step-wedge cluster randomised pilot study. Six Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs) are randomised into three clusters. Clusters receive the intervention staggered by 1 month. Health professionals report on their knowledge and skills pretraining and post-training and at the end of the study. Pregnant women are recruited and followed up for 3 months. The primary outcome is the recruitment rate of pregnant women. Secondary outcomes include feasibility of recruitment and follow-up of participating women, and webinar training of health professionals, measured using a designated log; and measures of effectiveness outcomes, including quit rates and NRT prescription rates.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Ethics and dissemination</jats:title><jats:p>In accordance with the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, this study has been developed in collaboration with a Stakeholder and Consumer Aboriginal Advisory Panel (SCAAP).

 abstract = {<jats:p>The use of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy has been debated but evidence suggests that it is safer than smoking. A cross‐sectional survey was conducted with: (i) general practitioners and obstetricians from a college database; and (ii) general practitioners with a special interest in Indigenous health. General practitioners had higher odds of prescribing compared to obstetricians. Reading guidelines, confidence, viewing nicotine replacement therapy as safe, effective and with good adherence, also significantly increased the odds of prescription. Clear guidance regarding safety and efficacy, with practical clinical protocols, are required in order to reduce variation in prescribing rates across these clinicians.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>Reports indicate that sensory issues may be related to atypical defecation habits in some children. Practice in this area is limited by the lack of validated measures. The THPQ-R appears to capture defecation behaviors related to sensory over-reactivity. While preliminary studies regarding the THPQ-R are promising, further examination of its validity is warranted. In this study, we examined discriminative and concurrent validity.</jats:p>

 abstract = {<jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>Treatment fidelity is an important and often neglected component of complex behaviour change research. It is central to understanding treatment effects, especially for evaluations conducted outside of highly controlled research settings. Ensuring that promising interventions can be delivered adequately (ie, with fidelity) by real-world clinicians within real-world settings is an essential step in developing interventions that are both effective and ‘implementable’. Whether this is the case for behaviour change counselling, a complex intervention developed specifically for maximising the effectiveness of real-world consultations about health behaviour change, remains unclear. To improve our understanding of treatment effects, best practice guidelines recommend the use of strategies to enhance, monitor and evaluate what clinicians deliver during patient consultations. There has yet to be a systematic evaluation of whether and how these recommendations have been employed within evaluations of behaviour change counselling, nor the impact on patient health behaviour and/or outcome. We seek to address this gap.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and analysis</jats:title><jats:p>Methods are informed by published guidelines. Ten electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis; Wiley, ProQuest and Open Grey) will be searched for published and unpublished articles that evaluate behaviour change counselling within real-world clinical settings (randomised and non-randomised). Eligible papers will be rated against the National Institute of Health fidelity framework. A synthesis, evaluation and critical overview of fidelity practices will be reported and linear regression used to explore change across time. Random-effect meta-regression is planned to explore whether fidelity (outcomes reported and methods used) is associated with the impact of behaviour change counselling. Standardised effect sizes will be calculated using Hedges’ g (continuous outcomes) and ORs (binary/dichotomous outcomes).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Ethics and dissemination</jats:title><jats:p>No ethical issues are foreseen.
