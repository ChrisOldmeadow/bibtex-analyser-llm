abdullah2014thea,The architecture of risk for type 2 diabetes: Understanding asia in the context of global findings,"<jats:p>The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly in both developed and developing countries. Asia is developing as the epicentre of the escalating pandemic, reflecting rapid transitions in demography, migration, diet, and lifestyle patterns. The effective management of Type 2 diabetes in Asia may be complicated by differences in prevalence, risk factor profiles, genetic risk allele frequencies, and gene-environment interactions between different Asian countries, and between Asian and other continental populations. To reduce the worldwide burden of T2D, it will be important to understand the architecture of T2D susceptibility both within and between populations. This review will provide an overview of known genetic and nongenetic risk factors for T2D, placing the results from Asian studies in the context of broader global research. Given recent evidence from large-scale genetic studies of T2D, we place special emphasis on emerging knowledge about the genetic architecture of T2D and the potential contribution of genetic effects to population differences in risk.</jats:p>","Asia, Genetic Association Studies, Genomic Association Studies, Type 2 Diabetes"
abdullah2018diffe,Differing contributions of classical risk factors to type 2 diabetes in multi-ethnic Malaysian populations,"<jats:p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is escalating rapidly in Asian countries, with the rapid increase likely attributable to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Recent research suggests that common genetic risk variants contribute minimally to the rapidly rising prevalence. Rather, recent changes in dietary patterns and physical activity may be more important. This nested case-control study assessed the association and predictive utility of type 2 diabetes lifestyle risk factors in participants from Malaysia, an understudied Asian population with comparatively high disease prevalence. The study sample comprised 4077 participants from The Malaysian Cohort project and included sub-samples from the three major ancestral groups: Malay (n = 1323), Chinese (n = 1344) and Indian (n = 1410). Association of lifestyle factors with type 2 diabetes was assessed within and across ancestral groups using logistic regression. Predictive utility was quantified and compared between groups using the Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). In predictive models including age, gender, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, location, family history of diabetes and average sleep duration, the AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.85 across groups and was significantly higher in Chinese than Malays or Indians, likely reflecting anthropometric differences. This study suggests that obesity, advancing age, a family history of diabetes and living in a rural area are important drivers of the escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Malaysia.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Genetic Association Studies, Longitudinal Study, Regression Analysis."
acharya2024spill,"Spillover effects from a type 2 diabetes integrated model of care in 22,706 Australians: an open cohort stepped wedge trial","<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Many Australian adults are not receiving timely or effective diabetes management to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes related complications. Integrated care, a worldwide trend in healthcare reform, aims to reduce the fragmented delivery of health services and improve outcomes. This study aimed to test whether a specialist-led integrated model of care provided to a small subset of patients in general practices leads to spillover clinical improvements in all patients of the practice with type 2 diabetes.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>Seventy-two general practice sites (clusters) in New South Wales, Australia received the Diabetes Alliance intervention, creating a non-randomised open cohort stepped wedge trial. The intervention comprised of case conferencing, delivered directly to a small proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1,072) of the general practice sites; as well as practice feedback, education and training. Spillover clinical improvements were assessed on all adults with type 2 diabetes within the general practice sites (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 22,706), using practice level data recorded in the MedicineInsight electronic database, compared before and after the intervention. Outcome measures included frequency of diabetes screening tests in line with the Annual Cycle of Care, and clinical results for weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, and kidney function.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>Compared to before Diabetes Alliance, the odds of all practice patients receiving screening tests at or above the recommended intervals were significantly higher for all recommended tests after Diabetes Alliance (odds ratio range 1.41–4.45, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.0001). Significant improvements in clinical outcomes were observed for weight (absolute mean difference: -1.38 kg), blood pressure (systolic − 1.12 mmHg, diastolic − 1.18 mmHg), HbA1c (-0.03% at the mean), total cholesterol (-0.11 mmol/L), and triglycerides (-0.02 mmol/L) (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). There were small but significant declines in kidney function.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>Integrated care delivered to a small subset of patients with type 2 diabetes across a large geographic region has spillover benefits that improve the process measures and clinical outcomes for all practice patients with type 2 diabetes.</jats:p>

allan2020aste,A stepped wedge trial of efficacy and scalability of a virtual clinical pharmacy service (VCPS) in rural and remote NSW health facilities,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Medication errors are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Clinical pharmacy services provided in hospital can reduce medication errors and medication related harm. However, few rural or remote hospitals in Australia have a clinical pharmacy service. This study will evaluate a virtual clinical pharmacy service (VCPS) provided via telehealth to eight rural and remote hospitals in NSW, Australia.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design will use routinely collected data from patients’ electronic medical records (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 2080) to evaluate the VCPS at eight facilities. The sequence of steps is randomised, allowing for control of potential confounding temporal trends. Primary outcomes are number of medication reconciliations completed on admission and discharge. Secondary outcomes are length of stay, falls and 28 day readmissions. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) will be conducted. The CEA will answer the question of whether the VCPS is more cost-effective compared to treatment as usual; the CBA will consider the rate of return on investing in the VCPS. A patient experience measure (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 500) and medication adherence questionnaire (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 100 pre and post) will also be used to identify patient responses to the virtual service. Focus groups will investigate implementation from hospital staff perspectives at each site.</jats:p>
<jats:p>Analyses of routine data will comprise generalised linear mixed models. Descriptive statistical analysis will summarise patient experience responses. Differences in medication adherence will be compared using linear regression models. Thematic analysis of focus groups will identify barriers and facilitators to VCPS implementation.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>
<jats:p>We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of virtual pharmacy interventions for rural populations, and inform best practice for using virtual healthcare to improve access to pharmacy services. It is widely recognised that clinical pharmacists are best placed to reduce medication errors. However, pharmacy services are limited in rural and remote hospitals. This project will provide evidence about ways in which the benefits of hospital pharmacists can be maximised utilising telehealth technology. If successful, this project can provide a model for pharmacy delivery in rural and remote locations.</jats:p>

The aim of this review was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and shorter versus longer duration of anticoagulation in patients with isolated distal DVT. A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews. Studies reporting rates of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent DVT, proximal extension, and/or major bleeding were included. Fourteen studies (six randomized controlled trials, eight cohorts) involving 2,918 patients met the eligibility criteria (with a total of 13 meeting criteria for the meta-analysis). Compared with no anticoagulation, anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduction in proximal extension (odds ratio [OR]: 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13–0.67; p &lt; 0.004), recurrent DVT (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04–0.65; p = 0.01), and the composite end-point of proximal extension/PE (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.16–0.72; p = 0.005); however, no significant differences in PE (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.17–1.34; p = 0.16) or major bleeding (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.33–6.86; p = 0.60) were observed.

This study aimed to assess the types of self-exempting beliefs reported by a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, and identify associations between these beliefs and other smoking-related factors with quit intentions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March–December 2012 with smokers seeking welfare assistance in New South Wales (NSW), Australia (n = 354; response rate 79%). Responses to a 16-item self-exempting beliefs scale and intention to quit, smoker identity, and enjoyment of smoking were assessed. Most participants earned &lt;AUD$400/week (70%), and had not completed secondary schooling (64%). All “jungle” beliefs (normalising the dangers of smoking due to ubiquity of risk) and selected “skeptic” beliefs were endorsed by 25%–47% of the sample, indicating these smokers may not fully understand the extensive risks associated with smoking. Smokers with limited quit intentions held significantly stronger self-exempting beliefs than those contemplating or preparing to quit (all p &lt; 0.01). After adjusting for smoking-related variables only “skeptic” beliefs were significantly associated with intention to quit (p = 0.02). Some of these beliefs are incorrect and could be addressed in anti-smoking campaigns.</jats:p>","Low-Income Groups, Smokers, Smoking Cessation, Substance Use, Surveys"

<jats:p>Physical and mental health risks often commence during young adulthood. Vocational education institutions are an ideal setting for understanding how health-risks cluster together in students to develop holistic multiple health-risk interventions. This is the first study to examine clustering of tobacco smoking, fruit intake, vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, overweight/obesity, depression, and anxiety in vocational education students and the socio-demographic characteristics associated with cluster membership. A cross-sectional survey with vocational education students (n = 1134, mean age = 24.3 years) in New South Wales, Australia. Latent class analysis identified clusters and latent class regression examined characteristics associated with clusters. Four clusters were identified. All clusters had moderate inadequate fruit intake and moderate overweight/obesity. Cluster 1 (13% of sample) had “high anxiety, high inadequate vegetable intake, low tobacco, and low alcohol use.” Cluster 2 (16% of sample) had “high tobacco smoking, high alcohol use, high anxiety, high depression, and high inadequate vegetable intake.” Cluster 3 (52% of sample) had “high risky alcohol use, high inadequate vegetable intake, low depression, low anxiety, low tobacco smoking, and low physical inactivity.” Cluster 4 (19% of sample) was a “lower risk cluster with high inadequate vegetable intake.” Compared to cluster 4, 16–25-year-olds and those experiencing financial stress were more likely to belong to clusters 1, 2, and 3. Interventions for vocational education students should address fruit and vegetable intake and overweight/obesity and recognize that tobacco use and risky alcohol use sometimes occurs in the context of mental health issues.</jats:p>","Adolescents, Mental Health, Obesity, Smoking Cessation, Substance Use"

austin2024cardi,Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Individuals Following Plant-Based Dietary Patterns Compared to Regular Meat-Eaters,"<jats:p>The adoption of dietary patterns emphasising higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods (plant-based diets, PBDs), continue to rise worldwide. PBDs have been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as major risk factors such as overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Evidence regarding the dietary profile and disease risk associated with various PBDs in comparison to traditional meat-eating diets are scarce within the Australian population. The aim of this study is to investigate the 5-year and 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) among Australians habitually following various PBDs compared to a regular meat diet (RMD). The Plant-based Diet (PBD) Study is a cross-sectional study consisting of healthy adults between aged 30-75 years from the Hunter Region (NSW) between 2021-2023. A validated FFQ was used to assess eligibility and categorise individuals who were habitually consuming one of five dietary patterns for at least 6 months into the following groups: vegan (nil animal products), lacto-vegetarian (LOV, including eggs and dairy), pesco-vegetarian (PV, including seafood with/without dairy and eggs), semi-vegetarian (SV, minimal consumption of animal products) or RMDs (including animal meat daily or multiple times/day)<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup>. 5-year and 10-year CVD risk was quantified using the Framingham Risk Equation<jats:sup>(2)</jats:sup> and the Australian Absolute CVD risk calculator, respectively. CVD risk and other quantitative measures was compared using One-way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis, and Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact for qualitative data. Directed acyclic graphs displayed confounding variables and mediators and a regression model was used to adjust for these. A total of 240 participants (median age 55(16), 77.5% female) with 48 participants in each group showed a significant difference in predicted 5-year risk of CVD (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05), however 10-year risk did not significantly differ across groups. 5-year CVD risk was significantly lower in the vegan group (1%) compared to the RMD, SV, PV, and LOV diet groups (all 2%). In comparison to a vegan diet, crude association showed those consuming a RMD had a 2.4% (95% CI 0.7, 4.1) higher 5-year risk of developing CVD, followed by 1.7% in LOV (95% CI 0.6, 2.9), 1.8% in PV (95% CI 0.5, 3), and 1.1% in SV (95% CI 0.2, 2.1). Significance was lost after adjusting for confounders such as age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity levels and BMI. This is the first study to purposefully sample Australians habitually following PBD, presenting novel population-based evidence for CVD risk. These findings suggest more restrictive PBDs such as vegan diets when compared to RMD may lead to lower CVD risk, however population-based longitudinal studies primary investigating the development of CVDs in the context of PBDs are warranted.</jats:p>","Cardiovascular Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Longitudinal Study, Plant-Based Diet"

Individuals following PBDs consumed significantly more daily serves of vegetables (1–1.5 serves), fruit (1 serve, vegan only), legumes/nuts (0.5–1 serves), and less discretionary choices (0.5–1 serves) compared to regular meat-eaters. All dietary patterns were adequate in protein, exceeded in fat, inadequate in carbohydrate and met recommended serves of fruit and vegetables, but not grains. Inadequate serves were observed for meat/poultry/eggs/beans/nuts among PBDs except pesco-vegetarians, and dairy among semi-vegetarians and regular meat-eaters. Vegans and lacto-vegetarians were inadequate in vitamin B12, LCn-3PUFA, iodine, and in addition calcium among vegans, iodine in pesco-vegetarians, and LCn-3PUFA in semi-vegetarians and regular meat-eaters.</jats:p>

bagade2022theh,The human right to safely give birth: data from 193 countries show that gender equality does affect maternal mortality,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
<jats:p><jats:bold>Background </jats:bold>While a reduction in the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has slowed, newer strategies are needed to achieve an ongoing and sustainable reduction of the MMR. Previous studies have investigated the association between health system-related factors such as wealth inequalities, healthcare access and use on maternal mortality. However, a women’s rights-based approach to address MMR has not been studied, excluding the health system-related factors. This study aimed to analyse the association between gender equality and MMR globally.<jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold>Using structural equation modelling (SEM), secondary and open access data from the United Nations and other international agencies from 193 countries were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Gender-sensitive variables that represented the theoretical, conceptual framework of the study were selected. The association between latent variable gender equality and the outcome, MMR, was examined in the SEM. A second SEM model (n=158) was designed to include two variables related to gender-based violence.<jats:bold>Findings </jats:bold>Out of 521 gender-sensitive variables, we used 11 variables to estimate two models in SEM (Goodness of Fit Index=0‧929 for Model 1 and 0‧939 for Model 2). The latent variable, gender equality, was negatively associated with MMR (p&lt;0‧001, Z=–6‧96, 95% CI: –6508.98 to –3141.89 for Model 1 and p&lt;0‧001, Z=–7‧23, 95% CI: –6045.356 to –3467.515 for Model 2).<jats:bold>Interpretation </jats:bold>Gender equality was significantly associated with maternal mortality. Investing in higher education for women, improving their paid employment opportunities, increasing participation in leadership roles and politics, reducing intimate partner violence (IPV) and ending child marriage can significantly reduce maternal mortality.</jats:p>","Gender Equality, Maternal Mortality, Structural Equation Modelling"

This secondary analysis explored the effects of past sexual (SA) and physical (PA) assault on depression, alcohol misuse, global functioning and attrition in the Depression and Alcohol Integrated and Single focussed Intervention (DAISI) project, whose participants (N = 278) received cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for their depression and/or alcohol misuse. Of the 278 DAISI participants, 220 consented to screening for past assault (either by a stranger or non-stranger) at baseline. Depression, alcohol, and global functioning assessments were administered at baseline and 3, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. A between-group analysis was used to assess differences between SA and No SA, and PA and No PA groupings, on adjusted mean treatment outcomes across all assessment periods. SA and PA participants had similar mean symptom reductions compared to No SA and No PA participants except for lower depression and global functioning change scores at the 12-month follow-up. People with coexisting depression and alcohol misuse reporting SA or PA can respond well to CBT for depression and alcohol misuse.

A cross sectional analysis of the mid-aged cohort (1946–1951) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health was conducted on completers of Survey 7 in 2013 with complete FFQ data available (n = 9102). Dietary patterns were categorized as PBD (vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian) and regular meat eaters. Meat eaters were further categorized into high and low consumption and outcomes included self-reported prevalence of IGT and DM. Participants were identified as regular meat eaters (n = 8937) and PBD (n = 175). Prevalence of IGT was lower in PBD (0–1.2%) compared to regular meat eaters (9.1%). Consolidation of PBD to a single group (vegetarians) indicated a lower prevalence of DM in vegetarians compared to regular meat eaters (3.9% vs. 9.1%). Women consuming meat daily/multiple times per day had significantly higher odds of IGT (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1 to 2.1, p = 0.02). Individuals consuming processed meat daily/multiple times per day had significantly higher odds of DM compared to those consuming less than daily (Odds ratio (OR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.3, p &lt; 0.0001). After adjustment for covariates, statistical significance was lost largely due to the addition of BMI to the model. Prevalence of IGT and DM were lower in women following PBD and higher in high consumers of meat and processed meat. The relationship between meat consumption and IGT/diabetes status appears to be mediated, at least in part, by an increase in body mass index (BMI). Future studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms and other lifestyle factors underpinning the association between high meat consumption and increased risk of IGT and DM.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Longitudinal Study, Obesity, Surveys"

It is central to understanding treatment effects, especially for evaluations conducted outside of highly controlled research settings.

Whether this is the case for behaviour change counselling, a complex intervention developed specifically for maximising the effectiveness of real-world consultations about health behaviour change, remains unclear. To improve our understanding of treatment effects, best practice guidelines recommend the use of strategies to enhance, monitor and evaluate what clinicians deliver during patient consultations.

Limited data exist regarding co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression among general practice patients. This study examined the prevalence of depression by level of alcohol misuse, and the sociodemographic factors associated with depression and increased alcohol misuse severity. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 3559 Australian general practice patients. Patients completed their demographic details, the Patient Health Questionnaire (9-item) and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (Consumption items). The prevalence of alcohol misuse and depression was 6.7%, and depression prevalence varied significantly according to level of alcohol misuse (P&lt;0.001). Age, gender, Aboriginality and number of chronic diseases were associated with depression and higher levels of alcohol misuse. These findings may assist General Practitioners in identifying those at risk of experiencing co-morbid depression and alcohol use, and aid in effective treatment and referral.

breannehobden2018preva,Prevalence and characteristics associated with concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse within Australian general practice patients,"<jats:p>

Objectives
This study sought to determine, among a large sample of Australian general practice patients: (1) the prevalence of smoking among different levels of alcohol misuse; and (2) whether the associations between demographic characteristics and alcohol use differ according to smoking status.

Methods
A cross-sectional survey was administered from 2010 to 2011 to 3559 patients from 12 Australian urban general practices. Patients reported their demographic details, smoking status and their alcohol intake.

Results
The overall prevalence of reported concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse was 7.8%. Smokers were 3.81-fold more likely to have a higher level of alcohol consumption than non-smokers (95% confidence interval 3.13–4.63; P&amp;lt;0.0001). There was evidence that smoking was an effect modifier of the relationship between alcohol misuse and chronic illness.

Conclusions
There was an increasing prevalence of smoking with increasing level of alcohol consumption. In addition, those with chronic conditions who smoked had greater odds of higher levels of alcohol consumption. Preventative interventions for these substances are needed to reduce the burden associated with concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse.

What is known about the topic?
Tobacco and alcohol are the most commonly used substances and contribute to over 10million deaths annually. The risk of disease is high when using either of these substances, however, concurrent use is associated with a greatly compounded risk. Australian data is limited regarding the prevalence of concurrent tobacco and alcohol misuse, however, international studies suggest variation in prevalence rates between different clinical settings.

What does this paper add?
This study examined the prevalence of concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse among different levels of alcohol misuse severity within an Australian general practice setting. Additionally it explored whether the associations between demographic characteristics and alcohol use differ according to smoking status.

What are the implications for practitioners?
This study has important implications for disease prevention and the delivery of preventive health services by general practitioners. Considering one in 100 clinical treatments provided in general practice relate to preventative smoking or alcohol counselling, it is critical that efforts are made to ascertain risk factors such as smoking and alcohol misuse to increase treatment rates. General practitioners should consider screening for smoking and alcohol misuse opportunistically during routine clinical encounters, as well as screening for smoking or alcohol misuse if one or the other is present.

For 88 carers who completed surveys, 33% were concerned about managing medications, and 40% reported difficulties with medication management, including resistive behaviours by people with dementia. Dose administration aids were used by 72% of carers; however, only 15% reported receiving a recent home medicines review by a community pharmacist. High carer strain was reported by 74% of carers. Carer comments described many issues that contributed to high carer stress, as well as their engagement in vigilant activities to maintain medication safety. Strategies that can contribute to carers managing medications and reducing their strain include an increased use of dose administration aids, increased provision of home medicines reviews, and increased education of health professionals to provide adequate support and education about managing medications.</jats:p>","Carers, Intervention Study, Mental Health, Randomised Controlled Trial"

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Quit for new life (QFNL) is a smoking cessation initiative developed to support mothers of Aboriginal babies to quit smoking during pregnancy. The state-wide initiative provides support for pregnant women and their households including free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and follow up cessation advice. Services are also supported to implement systems-level changes and integrate QFNL into routine care. This study aimed to evaluate: (1) models of implementation of QFNL; (2) the uptake of QFNL; (3) the impact of QFNL on smoking behaviours; and (4) stakeholder perceptions of the initiative.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A mixed methods study was conducted comprising semi-structured interviews and analysis of routinely collected data. Interviews were conducted with 6 clients and 35 stakeholders involved in program implementation. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Aboriginal Maternal and Infant Health Service Data Collection (AMDC) records for the period July 2012-June 2015 were investigated to examine how many eligible women attended a service implementing QFNL and how many women took up a QFNL support. Smoking cessation rates were compared in women attending a service offering QFNL with women attending the same service prior to the implementation of QFNL to determine program impact.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>QFNL was implemented in 70 services located in 13 LHDs across New South Wales. Over 430 staff attended QFNL training, including 101 staff in Aboriginal-identified roles. In the period July 2012-June 2015 27% (n = 1549) of eligible women attended a service implementing QFNL and 21% (n = 320) of these were recorded as taking up a QFNL support. While stakeholders shared stories of success, no statistically significant impact of QFNL on smoking cessation rates was identified (N = 3502; Odds ratio (OR) = 1.28; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.96–1.70; p-value = 0.0905). QFNL was acceptable to both clients and stakeholders, increased awareness about smoking cessation, and gave staff resources to support clients.</jats:p>

<jats:p>Data were collected from consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with baseline and follow-up perfusion imaging presenting to hospital within 4.5 hours of symptom onset at 7 hospitals. Logistic regression models were used for predicting the effect of the reperfused penumbral volume on the dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days and improvement of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 24 hours, both adjusted for baseline ischemic core volume.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results—</jats:title>
<jats:p>
This study included 1507 patients. Reperfused penumbral volume had moderate ability to predict 90-day mRS 0 to 1 (area under the curve, 0.77;

Understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional regions from non-functional. Recent evidence suggests that a binary classification of evolutionary rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly conserved functional elements. Given that the distribution of evolutionary rates is multi-modal, determining the number of modes is of paramount concern. Through simulation, we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from MCMC simulations in determining the dimension of a model.</jats:p><jats:p>Results: We utilize a deviance information criterion (DIC) approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria, and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances.

The aims of this study were to evaluate two versions of a commercially available web-based weight loss maintenance (WLM) program and examine whether the provision of enhanced feedback was associated with better WLM. The study was an assessor-blinded RCT of change in body mass index (BMI) over 12 months WLM. Participants were 227 adults (44% male, 42.3 ± 10.1 years, BMI 30.4 ± 4.1 kg/m2) randomized to either a basic (Basic WLM) or enhanced program with additional support (Enhanced WLM). Analysis was intention-to-treat with imputation using last observation carried forward. There was no significant weight rebound from the start of weight loss maintenance to 12 months for either group (mean: basic 1.3%, enhanced 1.5%) and limited change in secondary outcomes for either program. There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome of change in BMI (basic −0.5 (1.9) kg/m2, enhanced −0.5 (1.6) kg/m2, p = 0.93). In conclusion, a web-based WLM program was effective in preventing weight regain over one year following weight loss. However, the addition of personalized e-feedback provided limited additional benefits compared to a standard program. Given the potential reach of web-based approaches, further research examining which web-based program components optimize weight outcomes long-term is required.</jats:p>","Randomized Controlled Trial, Web-Based Program, Weight Loss Maintenance"
connor2021cd36,CD36 polymorphisms and the age of disease onset in patients with pathogenic variants within the mutation cluster region of APC,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes patients to colorectal cancer. FAP is the result of a loss of APC function due to germline pathogenic variants disrupting gene expression. Genotype-phenotype correlations are described for FAP. For example attenuated forms of the disease are associated with pathogenic variants at the 5’ and 3’ ends of <jats:italic>APC</jats:italic> whilst severe forms of the disease appear to be linked to variants occurring in the mutation cluster region (MCR) of the gene. Variants occurring in the MCR are phenotypically associated with hundreds to thousands of adenomas carpeting the colon and rectum and patients harbouring changes in this region have a high propensity to develop colorectal cancer. Not all patients who carry pathogenic variants in this region have severe disease which may be a result of environmental factors. Alternatively, phenotypic variation observed in these patients could be due to modifier genes that either promote or inhibit disease expression. Mouse models of FAP have provided several plausible candidate modifier genes, but very few of these have survived scrutiny. One such genetic modifier that appears to be associated with disease expression is <jats:italic>CD36</jats:italic>. We previously reported a weak association between a polymorphism in CD36 and a later age of disease onset on a relatively small FAP patient cohort.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>In the current study, we enlarged the FAP cohort. 395 patients all carrying pathogenic variants in <jats:italic>APC</jats:italic> were tested against three CD36 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP)s (rs1049673, rs1761667 rs1984112), to determine if any of them were associated with differences in the age of disease expression.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>Overall, there appeared to be a statistically significant difference in the age of disease onset between carriers of the variant rs1984112 and wildtype. Furthermore, test equality of survivor functions for each SNP and mutation group suggested an interaction in the Log Rank, Wilcoxon, and Tarone-Ware methods for rs1049673, rs1761667, and rs1984112, thereby supporting the notion that CD36 modifies disease expression.</jats:p>

We investigated the genetic contribution to variation in this important, health- and well-being-related trait in middle-aged and older adults. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 31 cohorts (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>=53 949) in which the participants had undertaken multiple, diverse cognitive tests. A general cognitive function phenotype was tested for, and created in each cohort by principal component analysis. We report 13 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in three genomic regions, 6q16.1, 14q12 and 19q13.32 (best SNP and closest gene, respectively: rs10457441, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=3.93 × 10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup>, <jats:italic>MIR2113</jats:italic>; rs17522122, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=2.55 × 10<jats:sup>−8</jats:sup>, <jats:italic>AKAP6</jats:italic>; rs10119, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=5.67 × 10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup>, <jats:italic>APOE/TOMM40</jats:italic>).

<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>PALEO is a single arm, phase II clinical trial in patients with previously untreated, oligometastatic or locoregionally advanced oesophageal or GOJ carcinoma and dysphagia. PALEO is sponsored by the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (AGITG). Participants receive 2 weeks of therapy with concurrent hypofractionated radiotherapy of 30Gy in 10 fractions to the primary tumour, weekly carboplatin AUC2, weekly paclitaxel 50 mg/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and durvalumab 1500 mg q4 weekly, followed by durvalumab monotherapy continuing at 1500 mg q4weekly until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or 24 months of therapy. A single metastasis is treated with stereotactic radiotherapy of 24Gy in 3 fractions in week 7. The trial primary endpoint is the progression free survival rate at 6 months. Secondary endpoints include duration of dysphagia relief, nutritional status change, quality of life, response rate, toxicity, progression free survival and overall survival. The tertiary endpoint is prediction of outcome based on biomarkers identified from patient serial blood samples collected pre- and post-radiotherapy.</jats:p>

<jats:p>Each anesthetic rapidly and reversibly activated ryanodine receptor 2, but only from the cytoplasmic side.

Halothane activated ryanodine receptor 2 in the absence and presence (2 mM) of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>At clinical concentrations (1 MAC), halothane desflurane and enflurane activated ryanodine receptor 2, whereas isoflurane and sevoflurane were ineffective. Dantrolene inhibition of ryanodine receptor 2 substantially negated the activating effects of anesthetics. Halothane acted independently of the adenine nucleotide–binding site on ryanodine receptor 2. The previously observed adenosine antagonism of halothane activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> release was due to competition between adenosine and ATP, rather than between halothane and ATP.</jats:p>

<jats:sec id=""j_sjpain-2017-0149_s_001"">
<jats:title>Background and aims:</jats:title>
<jats:p>Excessive opioid prescribing can lead to adverse consequences including stockpiling, misuse, dependency, diversion and mortality. Increased prescriptions to post-operative inpatients as part of their discharge planning may be a significant contributor. Primary aims included comparing the amount of opioids prescribed, consumed, left unused and their relationship with pain and functionality.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec id=""j_sjpain-2017-0149_s_002"">
<jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>
<jats:p>A total of 132 consecutive patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgery were prospectively audited. Daily oral morphine equivalent (DME) of opioids prescribed was compared with opioids consumed and amount left unused 7–10 days after discharge. For analysis, patients were split into three groups: total knee replacement (TKR), hand surgery (Hands), and miscellaneous (Misc).</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec id=""j_sjpain-2017-0149_s_003"">
<jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
<jats:p>The mean dose of opioid prescribed per patient was 108.5 mg DME. TKR consumed 33–35% more opioids than Misc (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>=0.0283) and Hands (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>=0.0975). Age was a significant independent factor for opioid consumption in the 50th and 75th percentiles of Hands (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>≤0.05). An average of 36 mg DME per patient was left unused with Hands having the highest median DME (37 mg) unused. In the total cohort, 26% of patients were discharged with more DME than their last 24 h as an inpatient and had at least 50% of their tablets left unused at follow-up.</jats:p>

elizabethfradgley2018syste,System-Wide and Group-Specific Health Service Improvements: Cross-Sectional Survey of Outpatient Improvement Preferences and Associations with Demographic Characteristics,"<jats:p>Efficient patient-centred quality improvement requires an understanding of the system-wide areas of dissatisfaction along with evidence to identify the programs which can be strategically targeted according to specific patient characteristics and preferences. This cross-sectional study reports the proportion of chronic disease outpatients selecting 23 patient-centred improvement initiatives. Using univariate tests and multivariable logistic regressions, this multi-site study also identifies initiatives differentially selected by outpatients according to clinical and demographic characteristics. A total of 475 outpatients participated (49% response). Commonly selected initiatives included: reducing wait-times (22.3%); convenient appointment scheduling (16.0%); and receiving up-to-date treatment information (16.0%). Within univariate tests, preferences for information and service accessibility initiatives were not significantly associated with specific subgroups. However, seven initiatives were preferred according to age, gender, diagnosis status, and chronic disease type within multivariate models. For example, neurology outpatients were more likely to select assistance to manage psychological symptoms when compared to oncology outpatients (OR: 2.89). Study findings suggest that system-wide programs to enhance information provision are strategic approaches to improve experiences across patient characteristics. Furthermore, a few initiatives can be targeted to specific groups and emphasized the importance of detailed scoping analyses and tailored implementation plans when designing patient-centred quality improvement programs.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Multivariate Analysis, Patient-Centered Care, Quality Improvement"

Given the general lack of availability of pregnancy-specific psychosocial assessment instruments, the aim of this study was to develop a short-form psychosocial assessment tool for the detection of women at risk of excessive gestational weight gain with research and clinical practice applications. A staged scale reduction analysis of the weight-related behaviours questionnaire was conducted amongst a sample of 159 Australian pregnant women participating in the Women and Their Children’s Health (WATCH) pregnancy cohort study. Exploratory factor analysis, univariate logistic regression, and item response theory techniques were used to derive the minimum and most predictive questions for inclusion in the short-form assessment tool. Of the total 49 questionnaire items, 11 items, all 4 body image items, n = 4 attitudes towards weight gain, and n = 3 self-efficacy items, were retained as the strongest predictors of excessive gestational weight gain. These within-scale items were highly correlated, exhibiting high item information function value statistics, and were observed to have high probability (p &lt; 0.05) for excessive gestational weight gain, in the univariate analysis. The short-form questionnaire may assist with the development of tailored health promotion interventions to support women psychologically and physiologically to optimise their pregnancy weight gain.

fealy2022model,Modeling the Predictive Value of Evidence-Based Referral Criteria to Support Healthy Gestational Weight Gain among an Australian Pregnancy Cohort,"<jats:p>Globally, there has been a renewed focus on addressing gestational weight gain (GWG). In Australia, the Department of Health pregnancy care guidelines recommend women be offered routine weighing and receive brief nutritional and physical activity support during antenatal care visits. Women gaining weight outside the Institute of Medicine (IOM)’s weight gain reference values are further recommended to be referred to a dietitian. However, professional and organizational barriers, including an absence of weight gain referral pathways and limited workforce resources, exist with the translation and scaling of these recommendations into practice. This study aimed to explore patterns of GWG among a cohort of Australian pregnant women and to determine if pregnancy weight gains of above or below 2 kg or 5 kg in the second and third trimester can be used to predict total GWG outside recommendations. Sensitivity, specificity, negative, and positive likelihood ratios were calculated. The most predictive time point was 24 weeks’ gestation using the minimum weight change parameter of +/−2 kg, demonstrating reasonable sensitivity (0.81, 95% CI 0.61–0.83) and specificity (0.72, 95% CI 0.61–0.83), resulting in 55% (n = 72/131) of the cohort qualifying for dietetic referral.

The model of care comprises three components: (1) a dedicated ‘healthy choices’ consultation offered by a ‘healthy choices’ clinician; (2) embedding information regarding risk factors into clients’ care plans; and (3) the continuation of preventive care by mental health clinicians in ongoing consultations. Evidence-based implementation strategies will support the model implementation, which will be tailored by being co-developed with service managers and clinicians. The primary outcomes are client-reported receipt of: (1) an assessment of chronic disease risks (tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol use and physical inactivity); (2) brief advice regarding relevant risk behaviours; and (3) referral to at least one behaviour change support. Resources to develop and implement the intervention will be captured to enable an assessment of cost effectiveness and affordability.

Evidence is limited regarding the dietary profile, diet quality, and nutritional adequacy of PBDs, including their impact on CVD risk compared with traditional meat-eating diets in Australians. The PBD Study (PBDS) is a cross-sectional study that will recruit 240 adults from the Hunter region (NSW) without known CVD who are habitually consuming vegan (no animal flesh/animal products), lacto-ovo vegetarian (dairy and/or eggs only), pesco-vegetarian (fish/seafood only), or semi-vegetarian (minimal animal flesh) diets or are a regular meat-eater. To investigate dietary profile, diet quality, nutritional adequacy, and CVD risk, questionnaires (medical history, demographics, and physical activity), blood samples (biomarkers), physical measures (anthropometry, blood pressure, body composition, and bone density), and dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire and diet history) will be collected. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests will compare the CVD risk and other quantitative measures, and Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact tests will be used for qualitative data. Directed acyclic graphs will determine the confounding variables, and linear regression and mediation analyses will account for the confounders and estimate the effect of dietary patterns on CVD risk. p-values will be adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control the False Discovery Rate to 5%.</jats:p>","Cardiovascular Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Diet, Health Risk Factors, Nutritional Adequacy"

<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Aims</jats:title>
<jats:p>Cardiac catheterization procedures are typically performed with local anaesthetic and proceduralist guided sedation. Various fasting regimens are routinely implemented prior to these procedures, noting the absence of prospective evidence, aiming to reduce aspiration risk. However, there are additional risks from fasting including patient discomfort, intravascular volume depletion, stimulus for neuro-cardiogenic syncope, glycaemic outcomes, and unnecessary fasting for delayed/cancelled procedures.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods and results</jats:title>
<jats:p>This is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized trial with a prospective, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) assessment based in New South Wales, Australia. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to fasting (6 h solid food and 2 h clear liquids) or to no fasting requirements. The primary outcome will be a composite of hypotension, hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, and aspiration pneumonia. Secondary outcomes will include patient satisfaction, contrast-induced nephropathy, new intensive care admission, new non-invasive or invasive ventilation requirement post procedure, and 30-day mortality and readmission.</jats:p>

<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background and Aims</jats:title>
<jats:p>Current guidelines recommend 6 h of solid food and 2 h of clear liquid fasting for patients undergoing cardiac procedures with conscious sedation. There are no data to support this practice, and previous single-centre studies support the safety of removing fasting requirements. The objective of this study was to determine the non-inferiority of a no-fasting strategy to fasting prior to cardiac catheterization procedures which require conscious sedation.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>This is a multicentre, investigator-initiated, non-inferiority, randomized trial conducted in Australia with a prospective open-label, blinded endpoint design. Patients referred for coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, or cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)-related procedures were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to fasting as normal (6 h solid food and 2 h clear liquid) or no-fasting requirements (encouraged to have regular meals but not mandated to do so). Recruitment occurred from 2022 to 2023. The primary outcome was a composite of aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, hyperglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia assessed with a Bayesian approach. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction score, new ventilation requirement (non-invasive and invasive), new intensive care unit admission, 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, 30-day pneumonia.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>A total of 716 patients were randomized with 358 in each group. Those in the fasting arm had significantly longer solid food fasting (13.2 vs. 3.0 h, Bayes factor &amp;gt;100, indicating extreme evidence of difference) and clear liquid fasting times (7.0 vs. 2.4 h, Bayes factor &amp;gt;100). The primary composite outcome occurred in 19.1% of patients in the fasting arm and 12.0% of patients in the no-fasting arm. The estimate of the mean posterior difference in proportions with credibility interval (CI) in the primary composite outcome was −5.2% (95% CI −9.6 to −.9), favouring no fasting. This result confirms the non-inferiority (posterior probability &amp;gt;99.5%) and superiority (posterior probability 99.1%) of no fasting for the primary composite outcome. The no-fasting arm had improved patient satisfaction scores with a posterior mean difference of 4.02 points (95% CI 3.36–4.67, Bayes factor &amp;gt;100). Secondary outcome events were observed to be similar.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and CIED-related procedures, no fasting was non-inferior and superior to fasting for the primary composite outcome of aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, hyperglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly better with no fasting. This supports removing fasting requirements for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization laboratory procedures that require conscious sedation.</jats:p>

This cross-sectional study reports the proportion of chronic disease outpatients selecting 23 patient-centred improvement initiatives. Using univariate tests and multivariable logistic regressions, this multi-site study also identifies initiatives differentially selected by outpatients according to clinical and demographic characteristics. A total of 475 outpatients participated (49% response). Commonly selected initiatives included: reducing wait-times (22.3%); convenient appointment scheduling (16.0%); and receiving up-to-date treatment information (16.0%). Within univariate tests, preferences for information and service accessibility initiatives were not significantly associated with specific subgroups. However, seven initiatives were preferred according to age, gender, diagnosis status, and chronic disease type within multivariate models. For example, neurology outpatients were more likely to select assistance to manage psychological symptoms when compared to oncology outpatients (OR: 2.89). Study findings suggest that system-wide programs to enhance information provision are strategic approaches to improve experiences across patient characteristics. Furthermore, a few initiatives can be targeted to specific groups and emphasized the importance of detailed scoping analyses and tailored implementation plans when designing patient-centred quality improvement programs.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Multivariate Analysis"
freund2022thep,The Prevalence and Correlates of Gambling in Australian Secondary School Students,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Youth gambling is associated with a range of harms. This study aimed to examine, among Australian adolescents, the prevalence of gambling (ever, in the last month, at-risk and problem), the most frequent gambling types and modalities, and to explore the student characteristics associated with gambling in the last month and with at-risk or problem gambling. Students aged 12–17 years from Victoria and Queensland answered gambling questions as part of the Australian Secondary School Alcohol and Drug (ASSAD) Survey in 2017. The ASSAD also included a series of questions about smoking, alcohol and other drug use, and mental health. A total of 6377 students from 93 schools were included in analysis. The prevalence of ever gambling and gambling in the last month was 31% and 6% respectively. Of students who had gambled in the last month, 34% were classified as at-risk and 15% were classified as problem gamblers. The most frequent types of gambling in the last month were horse or dog race and sports betting. Students who gambled in the last month did so most frequently via a parent or guardian purchasing or playing for them, at home or at a friends’ house, and online or using an app. Regression analysis indicated that male gender, having money available to spend on self, alcohol consumption in the last seven days, the number of types of advertisements seen in the last month, and the number of peer or family members who gambled in the last month, were significantly associated with the likelihood of students gambling in the last month. Male gender, some age categories, and exposure to more types of gambling advertising were also significant predictors of being classified as an at-risk or problem gambler. This large study of youth gambling provides data on gambling behaviours and related variables from a large sample of Australian secondary school students. Student characteristics, including male gender and exposure to more types of gambling advertising, were associated with an increased likelihood of gambling in the last month and of being classified as an at-risk or problem gambler. Further implications of the study findings are discussed.</jats:p>","Adolescents, Mental Health, School Children, Substance Use, Surveys"

This study analysed how often clinicians ask pregnant women about their use of e-cigarettes, cannabis, chewing tobacco, and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure. Two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken. A random sample of 500 General Practitioner (GP) members were invited from the National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NFATSIH) to complete an on-line survey, and 5571 GP and Obstetrician (OBS) members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) were sent a paper survey by mail. Questions on frequency of asking about the exposures used Likert Scales, later dichotomized to “often-always” and “never-sometimes”. Logistic regressions estimated associations between clinician type and asking about cannabis, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and SHS. An adjusted model reduced potential confounders of location, guidelines, gender and population. n = 378 GPs and OBS participated (6.2% response). In total, 13–14% asked “often-always” about e-cigarettes; 58% cannabis; 38% cannabis with tobacco; 27% SHS, and 10% chewing tobacco—compared to 95% of the sample asking about cigarette smoking. After adjustment, the odds of RANZCOG GPs (OR 0.34) and OBS (OR 0.63) asking about cannabis were lower compared to NFATSIH GPs. Clinician type was non-significant for asking about e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and SHS.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women were recruited for a cross-sectional survey in two regions of NSW N = 132. The 19-item survey questioned the likelihood that the participant would use the various supports for their health, to quit smoking, and for a baby or child’s health. Logistic regression analyses were performed on N = 98 with complete data. Older participants were less likely to use Facebook or the internet for their health, or the health of a child, but were more likely to consult with health professionals. Women who had quit smoking were less likely to use an app for their health compared to smokers. Women who had a child living in their household were less likely to use the internet for a child’s health. This community-based study revealed age-related differences for access to health services and differences according to smoking status. Patterns of internet and app use warrant further consideration when planning strategies to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children’s health.</jats:p>","Indigenous Health, Smoking Cessation, Surveys"

griffin2020ther,The receptor tyrosine kinase trka is increased and targetable in HER2-positive breast cancer,"<jats:p>The tyrosine kinase receptor A (NTRK1/TrkA) is increasingly regarded as a therapeutic target in oncology. In breast cancer, TrkA contributes to metastasis but the clinicopathological significance remains unclear. In this study, TrkA expression was assessed via immunohistochemistry of 158 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), 158 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) and 50 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). TrkA was expressed in cancer epithelial and myoepithelial cells, with higher levels of TrkA positively associated with IDC (39% of cases) (p &lt; 0.0001). Interestingly, TrkA was significantly increased in tumours expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), with expression in 49% of HER2-positive compared to 25% of HER2-negative tumours (p = 0.0027). A panel of breast cancer cells were used to confirm TrkA protein expression, demonstrating higher levels of TrkA (total and phosphorylated) in HER2-positive cell lines. Functional investigations using four different HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines indicated that the Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor GNF-5837 reduced cell viability, through decreased phospho-TrkA (Tyr490) and downstream AKT (Ser473) activation, but did not display synergy with Herceptin. Overall, these data highlight a relationship between the tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA and HER2 and suggest the potential of TrkA as a novel or adjunct target for HER2-positive breast tumours.</jats:p>","Cancer, Diagnostic Testing, Genetic Association Studies, Intervention Study"

This study aimed to assess the types of self-exempting beliefs reported by a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, and identify associations between these beliefs and other smoking-related factors with quit intentions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March–December 2012 with smokers seeking welfare assistance in New South Wales (NSW), Australia (n = 354; response rate 79%). Responses to a 16-item self-exempting beliefs scale and intention to quit, smoker identity, and enjoyment of smoking were assessed. Most participants earned &lt;AUD$400/week (70%), and had not completed secondary schooling (64%). All “jungle” beliefs (normalising the dangers of smoking due to ubiquity of risk) and selected “skeptic” beliefs were endorsed by 25%–47% of the sample, indicating these smokers may not fully understand the extensive risks associated with smoking. Smokers with limited quit intentions held significantly stronger self-exempting beliefs than those contemplating or preparing to quit (all p &lt; 0.01). After adjusting for smoking-related variables only “skeptic” beliefs were significantly associated with intention to quit (p = 0.02). Some of these beliefs are incorrect and could be addressed in anti-smoking campaigns.</jats:p>","Low-Income Groups, Smokers, Smoking Cessation, Substance Use, Surveys"

<jats:sec id=""sec003"">
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>Three scenarios were developed for depression related to increasing detection, treatment response and treatment uptake. The incremental costs, incremental number of successes (i.e., depression remission) and the incremental costs-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. In the modelled scenarios, increasing provider treatment response resulted in the greatest number of incremental successes above baseline, however, it was also associated with the greatest ICER. Increasing detection rates was associated with the second greatest increase to incremental successes above baseline and had the lowest ICER.</jats:p>

<jats:title>Background and Purpose—</jats:title>
<jats:p>Epidemiological studies show strong associations between kidney dysfunction and risk of ischemic stroke (IS), the mechanisms of which are incompletely understood.

<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods—</jats:title>
<jats:p>
Polygenic models were derived using genome-wide association studies meta-analysis results for 3 kidney traits: estimated glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine (eGFRcrea: n=73 998), eGFR using cystatin C (eGFRcys: n=22 937), and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (n=31 580). For each, single nucleotide polymorphisms passing 10

<jats:title>Background and Purpose—</jats:title>
<jats:p>Despite moderate heritability, the phenotypic heterogeneity of ischemic stroke has hampered gene discovery, motivating analyses of diagnostic subtypes with reduced sample sizes. We assessed evidence for a shared genetic basis among the 3 major subtypes: large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism, and small vessel disease (SVD), to inform potential cross-subtype analyses.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods—</jats:title>
<jats:p>Analyses used genome-wide summary data for 12 389 ischemic stroke cases (including 2167 LAA, 2405 cardioembolism, and 1854 SVD) and 62 004 controls from the Metastroke consortium. For 4561 cases and 7094 controls, individual-level genotype data were also available. Genetic correlations between subtypes were estimated using linear mixed models and polygenic profile scores. Meta-analysis of a combined LAA–SVD phenotype (4021 cases and 51 976 controls) was performed to identify shared risk alleles.</jats:p>

<jats:p>In this study, video-telehealth consultation was added to an existing program, the Aged Care Emergency (ACE) program, aiming at further reducing Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions. This controlled pre-post study introduced video-telehealth consultation as an additional component to the ACE program for acutely unwell residents in RACs. Usual practice is for RACs and ACE to liaise via telephone. During the study, when the intervention RACs called the ED advanced practice nurse, video-telehealth supported clinical assessment and management. Five intervention RACs were compared with eight control RACs, all of whom refer to one community hospital in regional New South Wales, Australia. Fourteen months pre-video-telehealth was compared with 14 months post-video-telehealth using generalized linear mixed models for hospital admissions after an ED visit and ED visits.

Evidence for effective weight loss interventions targeting young women is lacking. This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy and acceptability of a six-month targeted and tailored eHealth weight loss program for young women (Be Positive Be Healthe (BPBH)). Women aged 18–35 years were randomized to BPBH (n = 29) or control (n = 28). BPBH supported participants to modify diet and physical activity behaviours using evidenced-based strategies (e.g., self-monitoring) tailored for young women and delivered using e-health (website, social media, smartphone application, email, text messages). The primary outcome was a change in weight (kg) at six months. Acceptability was assessed via a process evaluation survey and usage of intervention components. No significant between-group differences were observed for weight, with significant mean differences favouring the intervention group observed for body fat (kg) (−3.10 (−5.69, 0.52), p = 0.019) and intakes of alcohol (g) (−0.69 (−1.33, 0.04), p = 0.037), vegetables (% energy/day) (4.71 (−2.20, 7.22), p &lt; 0.001) and energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (% energy/day) (−9.23 (−16.94, 1.52), p = 0.018).

This study explores patterns of health behaviors among a sample of Australian university students, and determines whether patterns of health behaviors are associated with psychological distress and demographic characteristics. Cross-sectional data from the University of Newcastle Student Healthy Lifestyle Survey 2019 were analyzed. Fruit and vegetable intake, sugar-sweetened beverage intake, physical activity, sitting time, smoking, alcohol intake, drug use, sleep and psychological distress were assessed. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns of health risk behaviors, and latent class regression to explore associations between psychological distress and demographic characteristics with health behavior classes. Analysis included 1965 students (mean age 25.8 ± 8.6 years, 70.7% female). Three patterns of health behaviors were identified: healthier (48.6%), moderate (40.2%) and unhealthy (11.2%) lifestyle classes. Students in the moderate and unhealthy lifestyle classes had higher odds of moderate (OR 1.43 and 2.37) and high/very high psychological distress risk (OR 2.71 and 11.69). Students in the unhealthy and moderate lifestyle classes had a higher odds of being male, younger, enrolled in transition to university and English language courses, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent and to report some financial difficulty.

hyde2019elect,Electronic health literacy among magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography medical imaging outpatients: Cluster analysis,"<sec>
<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Variations in an individual’s electronic health (eHealth) literacy may influence the degree to which health consumers can benefit from eHealth. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is a common measure of eHealth literacy. However, the lack of guidelines for the standardized interpretation of eHEALS scores limits its research and clinical utility. Cut points are often arbitrarily applied to the eHEALS item or at the global level, which assumes a dichotomy of high and low eHealth literacy. This approach disregards scale constructs and results in inaccurate and inconsistent conclusions. Cluster analysis is an exploratory technique, which can be used to overcome these issues, by identifying classes of patients reporting similar eHealth literacy without imposing data cut points.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify classes of patients reporting similar eHealth literacy and assess characteristics associated within each class.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>Medical imaging outpatients were recruited consecutively in the waiting room of one major public hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing their sociodemographic characteristics and eHealth literacy, using the eHEALS. Latent class analysis was used to explore eHealth literacy clusters identified by a distance-based cluster analysis, and to identify characteristics associated with class membership.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Of the 268 eligible and consenting participants, 256 (95.5%) completed the eHEALS. Consistent with distance-based findings, 4 latent classes were identified, which were labeled as low (21.1%, 54/256), moderate (26.2%, 67/256), high (32.8%, 84/256), and very high (19.9%, 51/256) eHealth literacy. Compared with the low class, participants who preferred to receive a lot of health information reported significantly higher odds of moderate eHealth literacy (odds ratio 16.67, 95% CI 1.67-100.00; P=.02), and those who used the internet at least daily reported significantly higher odds of high eHealth literacy (odds ratio 4.76, 95% CI 1.59-14.29; P=.007).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The identification of multiple classes of eHealth literacy, using both distance-based and latent class analyses, highlights the limitations of using the eHEALS global score as a dichotomous measurement tool. The findings suggest that eHealth literacy support needs vary in this population. The identification of low and moderate eHealth literacy classes indicate that the design of eHealth resources should be tailored to patients’ varying levels of eHealth literacy. eHealth literacy improvement interventions are needed, and these should be targeted based on individuals’ internet use frequency and health information amount preferences.</p>

Vegetables are a major source of dietary nitrate. Experimental data indicates that dietary nitrate can significantly reduce major risk factors for atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD), as nitrate can be metabolized to produce NO via the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the association between habitual dietary nitrate intakes and the incidence of self-reported CVD-related complications within a representative sample of middle-aged Australian women (1946–1951 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health). Women free from disease at baseline who had completed the food frequency questionnaire data were included. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) across quartiles for nitrate intakes. Of the 5324 women included for analysis, there were 1951 new cases of CVD-related complications over 15-years of follow-up. Women reporting higher total dietary nitrate intakes (Q4 &gt; 78.2 mg/day) and vegetable nitrate intakes (Q4 &gt; 64.4 mg/day) were 25% and 27% reduced risk of developing CVD-related complications respectively, compared with women reporting low total (Q1 &lt; 45.5 mg/day) and vegetable nitrate intakes (Q1 &lt; 34.8 mg/day). Our findings were consistent with other observational data indicating that dietary nitrate may explain some of the cardiovascular benefits of vegetable consumption.</jats:p>","Cardiovascular Disease, Dietary Intake, Longitudinal Study, Nitric Oxide, Vegetables"

A cross-sectional study in Australian general practice,"<jats:p>The negative health consequences of tobacco and risky alcohol consumption are compounded when used concurrently. Australian preventative health guidelines recommend that general practitioners (GPs) assess and provide evidence-based intervention. No studies, however, have examined the accuracy of GP detection of concurrent tobacco use and risky alcohol consumption or the factors associated with accurate detection. This study aimed to examine the: (i) accuracy of GP detection of concurrent tobacco and risky alcohol use compared to patient self-report; and (ii) GP and patient characteristics associated with accurate detection following a single clinical encounter. Patients attending 12 Australian general practices completed a survey assessing smoking and alcohol consumption. For each participating patient, GPs completed a checklist to indicate the presence of these risk factors. GP judgements were compared to patient self-report. Fifty-one GPs completed a health risk checklist for 1332 patients. Only 23% of patients who self-reported concurrent tobacco and risky alcohol use identified by their GP. Patients who visited their GP four to six times in the last year were most likely to have concurrent tobacco and risky alcohol use were identified. It is imperative to establish systems to increase detection of preventative health risks in general practice to enable the provision of evidence-based treatments.</jats:p>","Alcohol, General Practitioners, Smokers, Substance Use, Surveys"

<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have high rates of avoidable hospital admissions for chronic conditions, however little is known about the frequency of avoidable admissions for this population. This study examined trends in avoidable admissions among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people with chronic conditions in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A historical cohort analysis using de-identified linked administrative data of Aboriginal patients and an equal number of randomly sampled non-Aboriginal patients between 2005/06 to 2013/14. Eligible patients were admitted to a NSW public hospital and who had one or more of the following ambulatory care sensitive chronic conditions as a principal diagnosis: diabetic complications, asthma, angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary outcomes were the number of avoidable admissions for an individual in each financial year, and whether an individual had three or more admissions compared with one to two avoidable admissions in each financial year. Poisson and logistic regression models and a test for differences in yearly trends were used to assess the frequency of avoidable admissions over time, adjusting for sociodemographic variables and restricted to those aged ≤75 years.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Once eligibility criteria had been applied, there were 27,467 avoidable admissions corresponding to 19,025 patients between 2005/06 to 2013/14 (71.2% Aboriginal; 28.8% non-Aboriginal). Aboriginal patients were 15% more likely than non-Aboriginal patients to have a higher number of avoidable admissions per financial year (IRR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.20). Aboriginal patients were almost twice as likely as non-Aboriginal patients to experience three or more avoidable admissions per financial year (OR=1.90; 95% CI=1.60, 2.26). There were no significant differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in yearly trends for either the number of avoidable admissions, or whether or not an individual experienced three or more avoidable admissions per financial year (p=0.859; 0.860 respectively). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Aboriginal people were significantly more likely to experience frequent avoidable admissions over a nine-year period compared to non-Aboriginal people. These high rates reflect the need for further research into which interventions are able to successfully reduce avoidable admissions among Aboriginal people, and the importance of culturally appropriate community health care.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Indigenous Health, Registries, Rural Communities"

This study aims to describe changes in diet quality over 12 years among participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health in relation to changes in depressive symptoms. Women born between 1946 and 1951 were followed-up for 12 years (2001–2013). Dietary intake was assessed using the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies (version 2) in 2001, 2007 and every 2–3 years after that until 2013. Diet quality was summarised using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS). Depressive symptoms were measured using the ten-item Centre for Epidemiologic Depression Scale at every 2–3-year intervals during 2001–2013. Linear mixed models were used to examine trends in diet quality and its sub-components. The same model including time-varying covariates was used to examine associations between diet quality and depressive symptoms adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) index to assess diet quality. Minimal changes in overall diet quality and its sub-components over 12 years were observed. There was a significant association between baseline diet quality and depression (<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>=−0·24, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0·001), but this was lost when time-varying covariates were added (<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>=−0·04, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0·10). Sensitivity analyses showed similar performance for both ARFS and MDP in predicting depressive symptoms. In conclusion, initial associations seen when using baseline measures of diet quality and depressive symptoms disappear when using methods that handle time-varying covariates, suggesting that previous studies indicating a relationship between diet and depression may have been affected by residual confounding.</jats:p>","Depression, Diet Quality, Longitudinal Study, Mental Health, Nutrition"

This study aimed to compare PIMS and other medication data for PWD to determine whether these changed during hospitalization. Medications documented in patient’s records at admission and discharge were evaluated for PWD recruited to phase one of a prospective quasi-experimental pre/post-controlled trial that was conducted at two regional hospitals in NSW, Australia. The study sample included PWD or cognitive impairment having an unplanned admission to hospital. Data were collected using a purpose developed audit tool for medications and PIMs, and a Modified Anticholinergic Burden Scale. Total participants were 277, and results determined that the cognitive status of PWD is not always detected during an unplanned admission. This may make them more vulnerable to medication problems and poor outcomes. Polypharmacy and PIMS for PWD were high at admission and significantly reduced at discharge. However, PWD should be routinely identified as high risk at admission; and there is potential to further reduce polypharmacy and PIMs during admission to hospital, particularly psychotropic medications at discharge. Future studies should focus on evaluating targeted interventions designed to increase medication safety for PWD.</jats:p>","Cognitive Impairment, Hospitalization, Medication Safety, Older Adults, Polypharmacy"

<jats:p><jats:bold>Background </jats:bold>People with dementia (PWD) are at risk for medication related harm due to their impaired cognition and frequently being prescribed many medications. Few previous studies of PWD inpatients have been focused on medication safety interventions.This study aimed to evaluate an intervention designed to improve medication safety for people with dementia (PWD) and their carers during an unplanned admission to hospital. This article reports the effect of the intervention on potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), polypharmacy and anticholinergic burden scores for PWD in the study. <jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold>A quasi-experimental pre-post design using an intervention site and a control site was conducted in 2017-2019, in a regional area in New South Wales, Australia. PIMs, polypharmacy and anticholinergic burden were measured at admission, discharge and three months after discharge. In addition, medication reconciliation at admission and scoring of pharmacists recommendations using severity and relevance scores were measured. <jats:bold>Results </jats:bold>There were 628 participants including 350 in the post-intervention phase. Polypharmacy for these admissions was high, and there was approximately 30% reduction in the number of medications at discharge. PIMs at admission were also high, and decreased significantly at discharge however there was no treatment effect associated with the intervention. The mean anticholinergic burden score also decreased significantly between admission and discharge, however, no treatment effect was seen. <jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold>High rates of polypharmacy and PIMs in this study indicate this study population was admitted with multiple comorbidities. Reduced PIMs at discharge were correlated with reduced anticholinergic burden. Medication reconciliation resulted in many recommendations that contributed to the reductions in medications. Although the study did not report a treatment effect, reductions in the number of medications and PIMs reduced medication related risk for PWD. Reduced risks associated with inappropriate or unnecessary medications can reduce hospital admissions and adverse events for PWD.

kelly2020feasi,Feasibility of a mobile health app for routine outcome monitoring and feedback in mutual support groups coordinated by SMART recovery Australia: Protocol for a pilot study,"<sec>
<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Despite the importance and popularity of mutual support groups, there have been no systematic attempts to
implement and evaluate routine outcome monitoring (ROM) in these settings. Unlike other mutual support groups for addiction,
trained facilitators lead all Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery) groups, thereby providing an opportunity
to implement ROM as a routine component of SMART Recovery groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>This study protocol aims to describe a stage 1 pilot study designed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a
novel, purpose-built mobile health (mHealth) ROM and feedback app (Smart Track) in SMART Recovery groups coordinated by SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) The secondary objectives are to describe Smart Track usage patterns, explore psychometric properties of the ROM items (ie, internal reliability and convergent and divergent validity), and provide preliminary evidence for participant reported outcomes (such as alcohol and other drug use, self-reported recovery, and mental health).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>Participants (n=100) from the SMART Recovery groups across New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to a nonrandomized, prospective, single-arm trial of the Smart Track app. There are 4 modes of data collection: (1) ROM data collected from group participants via the Smart Track app, (2) data analytics summarizing user interactions with Smart Track, (3) quantitative interview and survey data of group participants (baseline, 2-week follow-up, and 2-month follow-up), and (4) qualitative interviews with group participants (n=20) and facilitators (n=10). Feasibility and acceptability (primary objectives) will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, a cost analysis, and a qualitative evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>At the time of submission, 13 sites (25 groups per week) had agreed to be involved. Funding was awarded on August 14, 2017, and ethics approval was granted on April 26, 2018 (HREC/18/WGONG/34; 2018/099). Enrollment is due to commence in July 2019. Data collection is due to be finalized in October 2019.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use ROM and tailored feedback within a mutual support group setting for addictive behaviors. Our study design will provide an opportunity to identify the acceptability of a novel mHealth ROM and feedback app within this setting and provide detailed information on what factors promote or hinder ROM usage within this context. This project aims to offer a new tool, should Smart Track prove feasible and acceptable, that service providers, policy makers, and researchers could use in the future to understand the impact of SMART Recovery groups.</p>

<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Mutual support groups are an important source of long-term help for people impacted by addictive behaviors. Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) and feedback are yet to be implemented in these settings. SMART Recovery mutual support groups focus on self-empowerment and use evidence-based techniques (eg, motivational and behavioral strategies). Trained facilitators lead all SMART Recovery groups, providing an opportunity to implement ROM.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>The aim of this stage 1 pilot study is to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a novel, purpose-built mobile health ROM and feedback app (&lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt;) in mutual support groups coordinated by SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) over 8 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>&lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt; was developed during phase 1 of this study using participatory design methods and an iterative development process. During phase 2, 72 SRAU group participants were recruited to a nonrandomized, prospective, single-arm trial of the &lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt; app. Four modes of data collection were used: ROM data directly entered by participants into the app; app data analytics captured by Amplitude Analytics (number of visits, number of unique users, visit duration, time of visit, and user retention); baseline, 2-, and 8-week follow-up assessments conducted through telephone; and qualitative telephone interviews with a convenience sample of study participants (20/72, 28%) and facilitators (n=8).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Of the 72 study participants, 68 (94%) created a &lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt; account, 64 (88%) used &lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt; at least once, and 42 (58%) used the app for more than 5 weeks. During week 1, 83% (60/72) of participants entered ROM data for one or more outcomes, decreasing to 31% (22/72) by the end of 8 weeks. The two main screens designed to provide personal feedback data (&lt;i&gt;Urges&lt;/i&gt; screen and &lt;i&gt;Overall Progress&lt;/i&gt; screen) were the most frequently visited sections of the app. Qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators supported the acceptability of &lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt; and the need for improved integration into the SRAU groups. Participants reported significant reductions between the baseline and 8- week scores on the Severity of Dependence Scale (mean difference 1.93, SD 3.02; 95% CI 1.12-2.73) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 (mean difference 3.96, SD 8.31; 95% CI 1.75-6.17), but no change on the Substance Use Recovery Evaluator (mean difference 0.11, SD 7.97; 95% CI –2.02 to 2.24) was reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of &lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt;. Given that sustained engagement with mobile health apps is notoriously difficult to achieve, our findings are promising. &lt;i&gt;SMART Track&lt;/i&gt; offers a potential solution for ROM and personal feedback, particularly for people with substance use disorders who attend mutual support groups.</p>

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Around 48% of all pregnancies in low- and middle-income countries are unintended. Unintended pregnancy may contribute to lower use of antenatal care (ANC); however, current research in the area is largely inconclusive due to the methodological approaches applied.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>Responses from 4493 women extracted from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) were used to assess the association between unintended pregnancy and subsequent uptake of at least one and at least four skilled ANC visits. For this, Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models with informative priors (representing a range of values within which the researcher is certain the true effect of the parameters included lies) were used, adjusting for other factors that affect ANC uptake. Informative priors were selected from the BDHS data collected in 2004, 2007, and 2011.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>Around 64% of women in Bangladesh who had at least one pregnancy within 3 years prior to the survey (that ended in a live birth) received ANC at least once, and of these around 32% used ANC at least four times. Mistimed (aOR, 0.73, 95% Cred I, 0.66–0.81) and unwanted (aOR, 0.69, 95% Cred I, 0.64–0.75) pregnancy were associated with reduced odds of attending the recommended minimum of four skilled ANC visits compared with wanted pregnancy. These likelihoods were even lower for at least one skilled ANC visit among women with a mistimed (aOR, 0.59, 95% Cred I, 0.53–0.65) or an unwanted pregnancy (aOR, 0.67, 95% Cred I, 0.61–0.74) than women with a wanted pregnancy.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>In Bangladesh, more than one-quarter of women who report an unintended pregnancy at conception and do not terminate the pregnancy are at high risk of not using ANC. It is important for policies to include women with unintended pregnancy in mainstream healthcare services. This will increase the use of ANC and reduce associated adverse consequences.</jats:p>

kingsland2021anim,An implementation intervention to increase the routine provision of antenatal care addressing gestational weight gain: study protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster trial,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Weight gain during pregnancy that is outside of recommended levels is associated with a range of adverse outcomes for the mother and child, including gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and obesity. Internationally, 60–80% of pregnant women report gaining weight outside of recommended levels. While guideline recommendations and RCT evidence support the provision of antenatal care that supports healthy gestational weight gain, less than 10% of health professionals routinely weigh pregnant women; discuss weight gain, diet, and physical activity; and provide a referral for additional support. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of an implementation intervention in increasing the provision of recommended gestational weight gain care by maternity services.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A stepped-wedge controlled trial, with a staggered implementation intervention, will be conducted across maternity services in three health sectors in New South Wales, Australia. The implementation intervention will consist of evidence-based, locally-tailored strategies including guidelines and procedures, reminders and prompts, leadership support, champions, training, and monitoring and feedback. Primary outcome measures will be the proportion of women who report receiving (i) assessment of gestational weight gain; (ii) advice on gestational weight gain, dietary intake, and physical activity; and (iii) offer of referral to a telephone coaching service or local dietetics service. Measurement of outcomes will occur via telephone interviews with a random sample of women who attend antenatal appointments each week. Economic analyses will be undertaken to assess the cost, cost-consequence, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of the implementation intervention. Receipt of all care elements, acceptance of referral, weight gain during pregnancy, diet quality, and physical activity will be measured as secondary outcomes. Process measures including acceptability, adoption, fidelity, and reach will be reported.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>
<jats:p>This will be the first controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a implementation intervention in improving antenatal care that addresses gestational weight gain. The findings will inform decision-making by maternity services and policy agencies and, if the intervention is demonstrated to be effective, could be applied at scale to benefit the health of women and children across Australia and internationally.</jats:p>

Depression, alcohol, and global functioning assessments were administered at baseline and 3, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. A between-group analysis was used to assess differences between SA and No SA, and PA and No PA groupings, on adjusted mean treatment outcomes across all assessment periods. SA and PA participants had similar mean symptom reductions compared to No SA and No PA participants except for lower depression and global functioning change scores at the 12-month follow-up. People with coexisting depression and alcohol misuse reporting SA or PA can respond well to CBT for depression and alcohol misuse.

lane2022optim,Optimising a multi-strategy implementation intervention to improve the delivery of a school physical activity policy at scale: findings from a randomised noninferiority trial,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>To maximise their potential health benefits, school-based physical activity policies need to be implemented at scale. This paper describes the third in a sequence of trials that sought to optimise an effective strategy (PACE) to assist schools’ implementation of a physical activity policy. Specifically, it aimed to determine the probability that a multi-strategy intervention adapted to reduce in-person contact (Adapted PACE) was “as good as” the original intervention (PACE) in increasing the weekly minutes of structured physical activity implemented by classroom teachers.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A noninferiority cluster randomised controlled trial was undertaken with 48 primary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Schools were randomised to receive PACE or a model with adaptations made to the delivery modes (Adapted PACE). Teachers’ scheduled minutes of weekly physical activity was assessed at baseline (Oct 2018-Feb 2019) and 12-month follow-up (Oct-Dec 2019). The noninferiority margin was set at − 16.4 minutes based on previous data and decision panel consensus. A linear mixed model analysed within a Bayesian framework was used to explore noninferiority between the two PACE models. A cost minimisation analysis was conducted from the health service provider perspective, using the Australian dollar (AUD).</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>The posterior estimate for the between group difference at follow-up was − 2.3 minutes (95% credible interval = − 18.02, 14.45 minutes). There was an estimated 96% probability of Adapted PACE being considered noninferior (only 4% of the posterior samples crossed the noninferiority margin of − 16.4 minutes). That is, the minutes of physical activity implemented by teachers at Adapted PACE schools was not meaningfully less than the minutes of physical activity implemented by teachers at PACE schools. The mean total cost was AUD$25,375 (95% uncertainty interval = $21,499, $29,106) for PACE and AUD$16,421 (95% uncertainty interval = $13,974, $19,656) for Adapted PACE; an estimated reduction of AUD$373 (95% uncertainty interval = $173, $560) per school.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>It is highly probable that Adapted PACE is noninferior to the original model. It is a cost-efficient alternative also likely to be a more suitable approach to supporting large scale implementation of school physical activity policies.</jats:p>

This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a multicomponent, multidisciplinary tissue plasminogen activator implementation package in increasing the proportion of thrombolyzed cases while maintaining accepted benchmarks for low rates of intracranial hemorrhage and high rates of functional outcomes at 3 months. A cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 hospitals in the early stages of thrombolysis implementation across 3 Australian states was undertaken. Monitoring of
<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVT</jats:styled-content>
rates during the baseline period allowed hospitals (the unit of randomization) to be grouped into 3 baseline
<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">IVT</jats:styled-content>
strata—very low rates (0% to ≤4.0%); low rates (&gt;4.0% to ≤10.0%); and moderate rates (&gt;10.0%). Hospitals were randomized to an implementation package (experimental group) or usual care (control group) using a 1:1 ratio. The 16‐month intervention was based on behavioral theory and analysis of the steps, roles, and barriers to rapid assessment for thrombolysis eligibility and involved comprehensive strategies addressing individual and system‐level change. The primary outcome was the difference in tissue plasminogen activator proportions between the 2 groups postintervention. The absolute difference in postintervention

<jats:p>Individuals with more education tend to live longer. Genetic variants have been discovered that predict educational attainment. We tested whether a “polygenic score” based on these genetic variants could make predictions about people’s lifespan. We used data from three cohort studies (including &gt;130,000 participants) to examine the link between offspring polygenic score for education and parental longevity. Across the studies, we found that participants with more education-linked genetic variants had longer-living parents; compared with those with the lowest genetic education scores, those with the highest scores had parents who lived on average 6 months longer. This finding suggests the hypothesis that part of the ultimate explanation for the extended longevity of better-educated people is an underlying, quantifiable, genetic propensity.</jats:p>","Genetic Association Studies, Longitudinal Study, Survival Analysis"
marsden2021impro,"Improving assessment, diagnosis, and management of urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms on acute and rehabilitation wards that admit adult patients: Protocol for a before-and-after implementation study","<sec>
<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Urinary incontinence (UI) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are commonly experienced by adult patients in hospitals (inpatients). Although peak bodies recommend that health services have systems for optimal UI and LUTS care, they are often not delivered. For example, results from the 2017 Australian National Stroke Audit Acute Services indicated that of the one-third of acute stroke inpatients with UI, only 18% received a management plan. In the 2018 Australian National Stroke Audit Rehabilitation Services, half of the 41% of patients with UI received a management plan. There is little reporting of effective inpatient interventions to systematically deliver optimal UI/LUTS care.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>This study aims to determine whether our UI/LUTS practice-change package is feasible and effective for delivering optimal UI/LUTS care in an inpatient setting. The package includes our intervention that has been synthesized from the best-available evidence on UI/LUTS care and a theoretically informed implementation strategy targeting identified barriers and enablers. The package is targeted at clinicians working in the participating wards.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>This is a pragmatic, real-world, before- and after-implementation study conducted at 12 hospitals (15 wards: 7/15, 47% metropolitan, 8/15, 53% regional) in Australia. Data will be collected at 3 time points: before implementation (T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), immediately after the 6-month implementation period (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and again after a 6-month maintenance period (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). We will undertake medical record audits to determine any change in the proportion of inpatients receiving optimal UI/LUTS care, including assessment, diagnosis, and management plans. Potential economic implications (cost and consequences) for hospitals implementing our intervention will be determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (HNEHREC Reference No. 18/10/17/4.02). Preimplementation data collection (T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) was completed in March 2020. As of November 2020, 87% (13/15) wards have completed implementation and are undertaking postimplementation data collection (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Our practice-change package is designed to reduce the current inpatient UI/LUTS evidence-based practice gap, such as those identified through national stroke audits. This study has been designed to provide clinicians, managers, and policy makers with the evidence needed to assess the potential benefit of further wide-scale implementation of our practice-change package.</p>

marsland2024ccl2,CCL2/CCR2 Expression in Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer and Patient Long-Term Outcome: 10-Year Results from the TROG 03.04 RADAR Trial,"<jats:p>This study investigated the prognostic value of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expression in locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation using the 10-year outcome data from the TROG 03.04 RADAR clinical trial. CCL2 and CCR2 protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies at the time of diagnosis were quantified by immunohistochemistry and digital quantification. CCR2 protein expression was detected in prostate cancer cells and was associated with prostate-specific antigen serum concentration (p = 0.045). However, neither CCL2 nor CCR2 tissue expression could predict prostate cancer progression, or other clinicopathological parameters including perineural invasion and patient outcome. In serum samples, CCL2 concentration at the time of diagnosis, as assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (median difference 0.22 ng/mL, 95% CI, 0.17–0.30) (p &lt; 0.0001) and normal controls (median difference 0.13 ng/mL, 95% CI, 0.13–0.17) (p &lt; 0.0001). However, circulating CCL2 was not statistically significant as a predictor of disease progression and patient outcome. In conclusion, this study shows that although CCL2 and CCR2 are expressed in prostate cancer, with an increased level of CCL2 in the serum, neither CCL2 nor CCR2 expression has a clinical prognostic value in locally advanced prostate cancer.</jats:p>","Cancer, Diagnostic Testing, Prognostic Study, Randomised Controlled Trial"

While the association between fetal growth and adult cardiometabolic outcomes is well-established, the role of the HPA-A in these relationships is unclear. This study aims to determine whether HPA-A function mediates or moderates this relationship. Approximately 2900 pregnant women were recruited between 1989-1991 in the Raine Study. Detailed anthropometric data was collected at birth (per cent optimal birthweight [POBW]). The Trier Social Stress Test was administered to the offspring (Generation 2; Gen2) at 18 years; HPA-A responses were determined (reactive responders [RR], anticipatory responders [AR] and non-responders [NR]). Cardiometabolic parameters (BMI, systolic BP [sBP] and LDL cholesterol) were measured at 20 years. Regression modelling demonstrated linear associations between POBW and BMI and sBP; quadratic associations were observed for LDL cholesterol. For every 10% increase in POBW, there was a 0.54 unit increase in BMI (standard error [SE] 0.15) and a 0.65 unit decrease in sBP (SE 0.34). The interaction between participant’s fetal growth and HPA-A phenotype was strongest for sBP in young adulthood. Interactions for BMI and LDL-C were non-significant.

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Governments internationally have invested hugely in the implementation and scale-up of school-based physical activity interventions, but have little evidence of how to best sustain these interventions once active implementation support ceases. This study will assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategy sustainability intervention on classroom teachers’ sustainment of energisers (short 3–5 min physical activity breaks during class-time) scheduled across the school day from baseline to 12 and 24-month follow-up.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 50 primary schools within the Hunter New England, Illawarra Shoalhaven, Murrumbidgee and Northern New South Wales (NSW) Local Health Districts of NSW Australia. Schools will be randomly allocated to receive either usual support or the multi-strategy sustainability intervention that includes: centralised technical assistance from a trained project officer; formal commitment and mandated change obtained from school principals; training in-school champions; reminders for teachers; educational materials provided to teachers; capturing and sharing local knowledge; and engagement of parents, carers and the wider school community. The primary trial outcome will be measured via a teacher logbook to determine the between-group difference in the change in mean minutes of energisers scheduled across the school day at 12 and 24-month follow-up compared to baseline. Analyses will be performed using an intention to treat framework. Linear mixed models will be used to assess intervention effects on the primary outcome at both follow-up periods.</jats:p>

<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>
<jats:p>This study will be one of the first randomised controlled trials to examine the impact of a multi-strategy sustainability intervention to support schools’ sustainment of a physical activity intervention. The proposed research will generate new evidence needed for the partnering organisations to protect their considerable investments to date in physical activity promotion in this setting and will provide seminal evidence for the field globally.</jats:p>

<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Atypical Congenital Obstructive Urethral Lesions (ACOUL) are uncommon causes of urethral obstruction in children. They include Cobb’s collar or Moorman’s ring, Type III posterior urethral valve (PUV), congenital urethral narrowing and anterior urethral valves. This study is aimed to evaluate the knowledge and current practice amongst clinicians attending to ACOUL. An international online case based questionnaire was performed.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Materials and methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A survey was administered to members of international urological societies. It included 22 clinical questions on cases with ACOUL (14 questions suitable for statistical analysis) using cases of Type I PUV as controls. Two sets of paired questions evaluated change in opinion(s) after additional information was provided.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>One hundred twenty-one participants responded with 71% reporting exposure of less than 5 cases per annum. In questions regarding diagnosis between 11.6% (14/121) and 21.5% (26/121) of participants identified the ACOUL as PUV. Among them, 66% of respondents agreed on ACOUL’s causative role in urethral obstruction. Gini coefficient was consistently lower for ACOUL compared to PUV: diagnosis (mean 0.33 vs. 0.44) and prognosis (0.23 vs. 0.43). High intra-rater concordance (kappa 0.420.57) was observed for paired questions–a mean of 5.79% (7.44% and 4.13% for questions 10 and 12, 16 and 17, respectively) of participants changed their answers from an alternate diagnosis to the correct diagnosis of ACOUL after viewing endoscopic images. High variation in management of ACOUL was noted (Gini 0.51).</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>This global snapshot survey identified substantial inconsistency among clinicians dealing with ACOUL. Although rarely encountered in clinical practice, better overall education of ACOUL is warranted.</jats:p>

nimishakumari2017aspir,Aspirin in the prevention of colorectal cancer recurrence.,"<jats:p> 578 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Aspirin use reduces the incidence of colorectal adenomas, and of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. There is limited data on the effect of aspirin in the secondary prevention of CRC, currently the subject of multiple prospective randomized trials. We aimed to test the hypothesis that aspirin reduces disease recurrence in patients diagnosed with early CRC at a high volume, single institution. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients (pts) treated with at least one cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II or III CRC over a 5yr period (2009–13). Patients with synchronous CRC were excluded. Aspirin use at the onset of adjuvant chemotherapy was sourced from the universal electronic recording of concomitant medications. Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare crude relapse free survival (RFS) between pts who were using aspirin to those who were not. Propensity score analyses was used to balance the groups according to potentially confounding variables: tumor site (colon vs rectum), tumor stage (II vs III), and adjuvant chemotherapy (oxaliplatin-based vs no oxaliplatin). The propensity scores were estimated through a multivariable logistic regression model, and a Cox proportional hazards model used to assess the effect of aspirin use on RFS in the sample weighted according to the inverse probability of receiving aspirin. Results: A cohort of 231 pts met eligibility criteria; median age 64yr; 50% colon, 50% rectal; 19% stage II, 81% stage III; 35% received oxaliplatin; 13% (n=31) were using aspirin and 26% of pts (n=61) developed CRC recurrence in median follow-up of 2.9yr. Unadjusted RFS was not significantly different for those using aspirin (log rank p value 0.88). There was good overlap in propensity scores for the two groups. The hazard ratio for RFS with aspirin use from the weighted Cox regression model was 1.2 (95% CI 0.62-2.29), indicating no statistically significant effect of aspirin on CRC relapse. Conclusions: In this single institution series, we did not find evidence that aspirin use at onset of chemotherapy had an effect on CRC relapse free survival. These results do not exclude an aspirin effect that is modest or restricted to select CRC subgroups. </jats:p>","Aspirin, Colorectal Cancer, Genomic Association Studies, Randomized Controlled Trial"
noraidatulakmaabdullah2014thea,The Architecture of Risk for Type 2 Diabetes: Understanding Asia in the Context of Global Findings,"<jats:p>The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly in both developed and developing countries. Asia is developing as the epicentre of the escalating pandemic, reflecting rapid transitions in demography, migration, diet, and lifestyle patterns. The effective management of Type 2 diabetes in Asia may be complicated by differences in prevalence, risk factor profiles, genetic risk allele frequencies, and gene-environment interactions between different Asian countries, and between Asian and other continental populations. To reduce the worldwide burden of T2D, it will be important to understand the architecture of T2D susceptibility both within and between populations. This review will provide an overview of known genetic and nongenetic risk factors for T2D, placing the results from Asian studies in the context of broader global research. Given recent evidence from large-scale genetic studies of T2D, we place special emphasis on emerging knowledge about the genetic architecture of T2D and the potential contribution of genetic effects to population differences in risk.</jats:p>","Asia, Genetic Association Studies, Population Differences, Risk Factors, Type 2 Diabetes"

Eligible patients with chronic low back pain (n=160) were randomised to an intervention or usual care control group. The intervention included brief advice, a clinical consultation and referral to a 6-month telephone-based healthy lifestyle coaching service. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index. Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs and work absenteeism costs. An economic analysis was performed from the societal perspective. Mean total costs were lower in the intervention group than the control group (-$614; 95%CI: -3133 to 255). The intervention group had significantly lower healthcare costs (-$292; 95%CI: -872 to -33), medication costs (-$30; 95%CI: -65 to -4) and absenteeism costs (-$1000; 95%CI: -3573 to -210). For all outcomes, the intervention was on average less expensive and more effective than usual care, and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared to usual care was relatively high (i.e. 0.81) at a willingness-to-pay of $0/unit of effect. However, the probability of cost-effectiveness was not as favourable among sensitivity analyses. The healthy lifestyle intervention seems to be cost-effective from the societal perspective. However, variability in the sensitivity analyses indicates caution is needed when interpreting these findings.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Intervention Study, Obesity, Randomised Controlled Trial, Regression Analysis"

Although justified in avoiding false positives, this conservative approach has the potential to miss true associations as most studies are drastically underpowered. As an alternative to increasing sample size, we compare results from a typical SNP‐by‐SNP analysis with three other methods that incorporate regional information in order to boost or dampen an otherwise noisy signal: the haplotype method (Schaid et al. [<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""#bib25"">2002</jats:ext-link>] Am J Hum Genet 70:425–434), the gene‐based method (Liu et al.

Using a modestly sized case‐control study, we conduct a genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) of age‐related macular degeneration, and find striking agreement across all methods in regions of known associated variants. We also find strong evidence of novel associated variants in two regions (Chromosome <jats:italic>2p25</jats:italic> and Chromosome <jats:italic>10p15</jats:italic>) in which the individual SNP <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>‐values are only suggestive, but where there are very high levels of agreement between all methods.

The most recent studies or reports from included countries (n = 73) with national-level consumption data of SSBs in children and adolescents, collected between January 2010 and October 2019, were considered for inclusion. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled estimates of the mean consumption of SSB in millimeters per day. Heterogeneity between national estimates was assessed using the I<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> statistic and explored via subgroup analyses by the World Health Organization region, age groups, and country-level income. Forty-eight studies were included in the review reporting national estimates of consumption for 51 countries. The highest estimate of daily consumption was in China at 710.0 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) [698.8, 721.2], while the lowest was in Australia at 115.1 mL (95% CI [111.2, 119.1]). Pooled synthesis of daily SSB consumption of the 51 countries was 326.0 mL (95% CI [288.3, 363.8]), although heterogeneity was high, and was not explained by subgroup analyses. While there is considerable variability between countries, intake of SSB remains high among children and adolescents internationally underscoring the need for public health efforts to reduce SSBs consumption. </jats:p>","Adolescents, Chronic Kidney Disease, Obesity, Surveys"

<jats:p>Objective
To estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults with overweight or obesity without metabolic risk factors using a Bayesian survival analysis.
Design:
Prospective cohort study with median follow-up of 9.7 years.
Setting:
Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.
Participants
: A total of 2313 community-dwelling older men and women.
Intervention/exposure:
Participants without known CVD and with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 kgm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> were stratified by BMI and metabolic risk to create six BMI-metabolic health categories. Metabolic risk was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria for metabolic syndrome. “Metabolically healthy” was defined as absence of metabolic risk factors. Bayesian survival analysis, incorporating prior information from a previously published meta-analysis was used to assess the effect of BMI-metabolic health categories on time from recruitment to CVD.
Main Outcome:
Incident physician-diagnosed CVD, defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, angina, or coronary revascularisation procedure, was determined by linkage to hospital admissions records and Medicare Australia data. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality.
Results
From 2313 adults with complete metabolic health data over a median follow-up of 9.7 years, 283 incident CVD events, 58 CVD related deaths and 277 deaths from any cause occurred. In an adjusted Bayesian survival model of complete cases with informative prior and metabolically healthy normal weight as the reference group, the risk of CVD was increased in metabolically healthy overweight (HR = 1.52, 95% credible interval 0.96–2.36), and in metabolically healthy obesity (HR = 1.86, 95% credible interval 1.14–3.08). Imputation of missing metabolic health and confounding data did not change the results.
Conclusion
There was increased risk of CVD in older adults with overweight or obesity, even in the absence of any metabolic abnormality. This argues against the notion of “metabolically healthy” overweight or obesity.</jats:p>","Bayesian Survival Analysis, Cardiovascular Disease, Obesity, Older Adults"
opio2024metab,"Metabolic Health, Overweight or Obesity, and Depressive Symptoms among Older Australian Adults","<jats:p>Background: The relationship between overweight or obesity and depressive symptoms in individuals with or without cardio-metabolic abnormalities is unclear. In a cross-sectional study we examined the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms in overweight or obese older adults with or without metabolic abnormalities. Methods: The participants included 3318 older adults from the Hunter Community Study Cohort with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 kgm2, stratified by BMI and metabolic health risk. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kgm2 and metabolically healthy as the absence of metabolic risk factors, according to International Diabetic Federation criteria for metabolic syndromes. Moderate to severe depressive symptoms were defined as a Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score ≥ 16. Results: Compared to the metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) group, the odds of experiencing moderate/severe depressive symptoms were higher in those classified as a metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.76–2.06) or metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.00–2.19), but not in those classified as metabolically unhealthy overweight (MUOW) (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.63–1.45), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW) (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.51–1.26), and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.65–1.64). Compared with MHNW males, the odds of moderate/severe depressive symptoms were increased in all other BMI category–metabolic health groups for males and females. Limitations: Our relatively small sample size and cross-sectional design did not allow us to robustly establish causality. Conclusion: The odds of experiencing moderate/severe depressive symptoms were increased in metabolically unhealthy older adults regardless of normal weight or obesity, with the odds of having moderate/severe depressive symptoms being higher in females than in males.</jats:p>","Cardiovascular Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Mental Health, Obesity, Older Adults"

The correlation was moderate for the number and proportion of Type 2 diabetes patients per service in the group aged 18–34 years (ICC = 0.65 and 0.8–0.82 respectively). Strong to very strong correlations were found for numbers and proportions of patients being tested for diabetes, and for appropriate monitoring of patients known to have diabetes (ICC = 0.998–1.00). This indicated a generally high degree of concordance between whole-service data extracted by the two Clinical Decision Support Systems. Therefore, the less expensive or less complex option (depending on the individual circumstances of the service) may be appropriate for monitoring diabetes testing and care. However, the extraction of data about subgroups of patients may not be interchangeable.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Electronic Health Records, Indigenous Health, Randomised Controlled Trial"
revelas2019excep,Exceptional longevity and polygenic risk for cardiovascular health,"<jats:p>Studies investigating exceptionally long-lived (ELL) individuals, including genetic studies, have linked cardiovascular-related pathways, particularly lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, with longevity. This study explored the genetic profiles of ELL individuals (cases: n = 294, 95–106 years; controls: n = 1105, 55–65 years) by assessing their polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on a genome wide association study (GWAS) threshold of p &lt; 5 × 10−5. PRS were constructed using GWAS summary data from two exceptional longevity (EL) analyses and eight cardiovascular-related risk factors (lipids) and disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke) analyses. A higher genetic risk for exceptional longevity (EL) was significantly associated with longevity in our sample (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19–1.20, p = 0.00804 and 0.00758, respectively). Two cardiovascular health PRS were nominally significant with longevity (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), with higher PRS associated with EL, but these relationships did not survive correction for multiple testing. In conclusion, ELL individuals did not have significantly lower polygenic risk for the majority of the investigated cardiovascular health traits. Future work in larger cohorts is required to further explore the role of cardiovascular-related genetic variants in EL.</jats:p>","Cardiovascular Disease, Genetic Association Studies, Genomic Association Studies, Longitudinal Study"

Dysregulation leads to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and negative health outcomes. Recent exceptional longevity (EL) genome wide association studies have facilitated estimation of an individual’s polygenic risk score (PRS) for EL. We tested the hypothesis that individuals with high ELPRS have a low prevalence of MetS. Participants were from five cohorts of middle-aged to older adults. The primary analyses were performed in the UK Biobank (UKBB) (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 407,800, 40–69 years). Replication analyses were undertaken using three Australian studies: Hunter Community Study (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 2122, 55–85 years), Older Australian Twins Study (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 539, 65–90 years) and Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 925, 70–90 years), as well as the Swedish Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 2273, 70–93 years). MetS was defined using established criteria. Regressions and meta-analyses were performed with the ELPRS and MetS and its components. Generally, MetS prevalence (22–30%) was higher in the older cohorts. In the UKBB, high EL polygenic risk was associated with lower MetS prevalence (OR = 0.94,<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 1.84 × 10<jats:sup>–42</jats:sup>) and its components (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 2.30 × 10<jats:sup>–<jats:bold>8</jats:bold></jats:sup>).

<jats:p>This paper describes the statistical analysis plan for a randomised controlled trial of a Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP) for low back pain targeting multiple health risks and behaviours, weight, physical activity, diet and smoking, to improve disability. We describe the methods for the main analyses and economic analysis of the trial.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods and design</jats:title>
<jats:p>The trial is a two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of the HeLP intervention to usual care on low back pain disability at 26 weeks. A total of 346 adults with low back pain were recruited from the Newcastle and Hunter region between September 2017 and November 2019 and randomised to either HeLP or usual care. HeLP is a 6-month intervention with participant outcomes measured at weeks 6, 12, 26 and 52 post randomisation. This statistical analysis plan describes data integrity, handling and preparation of data for analyses and methods for analyses. The primary endpoint for the trial is disability at 26 weeks using the 24-item self-report Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle using linear mixed regression models.</jats:p>

This study aimed to develop a tool to quantify household cooking environments and establish its content validity, face validity, and inter-rater agreement. Methods: The Home Cooking EnviRonment and equipment Inventory observation form (Home-CookERI™) was developed as a 24-question (91-item) online survey. Items included domestic spaces and resources for storage, disposal, preparation, and cooking of food or non-alcoholic beverages. Home-CookERITM was piloted to assess content validity, face validity, and usability with six Australian experts (i.e., dietitians, nutrition researchers, chefs, a food technology teacher, and a kitchen designer) and 13 laypersons. Pilot participants provided feedback in a 10 min telephone interview. Home-CookERI™ was modified to an 89-item survey in line with the pilot findings. Inter-rater agreement was examined between two trained raters in 33 unique Australian households. Raters were required to observe each item before recording a response. Home occupants were instructed to only assist with locating items if asked. Raters were blinded to each other’s responses. Inter-rater agreement was calculated by Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (κ) for each item. To optimize κ, similar items were grouped together reducing the number of items to 81. Results: Home-CookERITM had excellent content and face validity with responding participants; all 24 questions were both clear and relevant (X2 (1, n = 19; 19.0, p = 0.392)). Inter-rater agreement for the modified 81-item Home-CookERI™ was almost-perfect to perfect for 46% of kitchen items (n = 37 items, κ = 0.81–1), moderate to substantial for 28% (n = 23, κ = 0.51–0.8), slight to fair for 15% (n = 12, κ = 0.01–0.5), and chance or worse for 11% of items (n = 9, κ ≤ 0.0). Home-CookERITM was further optimized by reduction to a 77-item version, which is now available to researchers. Conclusion: Home-CookERI™ is a comprehensive tool for quantifying Australian household cooking environments. It has excellent face and content validity and moderate to perfect inter-rater agreement for almost three-quarters of included kitchen items. To expand Home-CookERI™ applications, a home occupant self-completion version is planned for validation.</jats:p>","Data Sources, Nutrition Epidemiology, Surveys, Validation Study"

The origins of CVD may commence during pregnancy, yet few serum reference values for CVD biomarkers exist specific to the pregnancy period. The Gomeroi gaaynggal research project is a program that undertakes research and provides some health services to pregnant Indigenous women. Three hundred and ninety-nine non-fasting samples provided by the study participants (206 pregnancies and 175 women) have been used to construct reference intervals for CVD biomarkers during this critical time. A pragmatic design was used, in that women were not excluded for the presence of chronic or acute health states. Percentile bands for non-linear relationships were constructed according to the methods of Wright and Royston (2008), using the xriml package in StataIC 13.1. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, cystatin-C and alkaline phosphatase increased as gestational age progressed, with little change seen in high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and γ glutamyl transferase. Values provided in the reference intervals are consistent with findings from other research projects. These reference intervals will form a basis with which future CVD biomarkers for pregnant Indigenous Australian women can be compared.</jats:p>","Cardiovascular Disease, Cvd Biomarkers, Indigenous Australians, Pregnancy, Reference Intervals"

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Why adolescents’ drinking is associated with their parents’ drinking remains unclear. We examined associations in a prospective cohort study, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and family factors.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>We recruited 1927 children from grade 7 classes (mean age 13 years), and one of their parents, in three Australian states, contacted participants annually from 2010 to 2014, and analysed data from assessments at ages 13, 14, 15 and 16 years. We used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) subscale to identify hazardous drinking in parents (score ≥5) and children (score ≥3) and constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models, accounting for clustering within school and adjusting for likely confounders. We evaluated the sensitivity of estimates by imputing missing values assuming the data were missing at random vs. missing not at random.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>Parent hazardous drinking predicted mid-adolescent hazardous drinking, e.g. 15 years olds whose parents [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.00; 95% confidence interval 1.51–2.64] or parents’ partners (aOR 1.94; 1.48–2.55) were hazardous drinkers had higher odds of being hazardous drinkers at age 16. The magnitude of univariate associations changed little after adjusting for covariates, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the association, across a wide range of assumptions about the missing data.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>The associations between parents’ and their adolescent children’s hazardous drinking are unlikely to be due to confounding by socio-demographic and family factors. Parents should be encouraged, and supported by public policy, to reduce their own alcohol consumption in order to reduce their children’s risk of becoming hazardous drinkers.</jats:p>

sinclair2019anev,An evaluation of general practice nurses{'} knowledge of chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practices following completion of a case study-based asynchronous e-learning module,"<jats:p>
National and international guidelines recommend opportunistic screening for chronic kidney disease to allow for early detection and management. Despite these guidelines, screening for chronic kidney disease in general practice settings is often suboptimal. This paper reports the results of a study that evaluated: (a) the effect of an asynchronous web-based e-learning module on general practice nurses’ knowledge about chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practices; and (b) general practice nurses’ perceived satisfaction with the e-learning module. Changes in chronic kidney disease knowledge were assessed using a pre-test and post-test evaluative design, and satisfaction scores were measured on completion of the module. Participants’ baseline knowledge scores were poor, with mean pre-test scores of 3.77 (s.d. 1.66) out of 10. Post-test scores revealed a significant improvement (mean difference 1.81, (95% CI: 1.53 – 2.09), P &amp;lt; 0.01); however, overall final scores remained inadequate. Participants highly rated their satisfaction with the design of the module. Our results suggest that an asynchronous web-based e-learning module can improve general practice nurses’ knowledge about chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practice. Efforts are required to increase practice nurses’ access to educational opportunities designed to improve knowledge in this area with the aim of increasing opportunistic screening for chronic kidney disease in the general practice setting.

<jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>
<jats:p>We conducted a multicenter, prospective, combined non-inferiority (PI-Alc vs C-Alc) and superiority (PI-Alc vs PI-Aq) randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either C-Alc, PI-Alc, or PI-Aq. The primary outcome was SSI rate as defined by the Centers for Disease Control.

sprott2019asses,Assessment of Restored Kidney Transplantation Including the Use of Wider Criteria for Accepting Renal Donors After Cancer Excision,"<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background.</jats:title>
<jats:p>The transplantation of kidneys after cancer excision (restored kidney transplantation, RKT) warrants further evaluation as a source of kidneys for transplantation. We determined whether larger cancers can be safely transplanted, the risks of adverse events from RKT, and whether RKT confers a survival advantage for patients waiting for transplantation.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods.</jats:title>
<jats:p>In a retrospective cohort study, 23 dialysis patients awaiting transplant underwent RKT at John Hunter Hospital, Australia between 2008 and 2015. Patients were &gt;60 years old and accepted onto the National Organ Matching Service. This RKT Group was divided into donor renal cancers ≤30 mm and &gt;30–≤50 mm. Adverse event profiles for RKT recipients were compared with 22 standard live donor recipients using logistic regression analyses. Recipient and transplant survivals for RKT were compared with 2050 controls from Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry using Cox regression models. To increase statistical power for survival analyses, data from 25 RKT recipients from Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane were added, thus creating 48 RKT recipients.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results.</jats:title>
<jats:p>There were no significant differences in mortality, transplant failure nor AEs between the 2 cancer Groups. RKT increased the risks of Adverse event profiles (odds ratio: 6.48 [2.92–15.44]; <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). RKT reduced mortality risk by 30% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70 [0.36–1.07]; <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> = 0.299) compared with those continuing on the transplant list who may or may not be transplanted. RKT significantly reduced mortality risk for those remaining on dialysis (HR: 2.86 [1.43–5.72]; <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> = 0.003). Transplant survival for RKT was reduced compared with control deceased donor (HR: 0.42 [0.21–0.83]; <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> = 0.013) and live donor transplants (HR: 0.33 [0.02–0.86]; <jats:italic toggle=""yes"">P</jats:italic> =0.023).</jats:p>

<jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>
<jats:p>
Cross-sectional survey of adult clients from 12 community mental health services across 3 local health districts in New South Wales, Australia, collected from 2021 to 2022. Participants (
<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>

<jats:p>
Participants most commonly reported a diagnosis of schizophrenia (36.7%) or depression (21.1%). Risk factors were prevalent: ranging from 26% (harmful alcohol use) to 97% (poor nutrition). High readiness was greatest for smoking (68%), weight (66%) and physical inactivity (63%), while confidence was highest for changing alcohol use (67%). Two significant associations were identified; females were more likely than males to have high readiness to change nutrition (odds ratio = 1.14, confidence interval = [1.13, 2.34],

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Transfer of residential aged-care facility (RACF) residents to Emergency Departments (ED) is common, risky and expensive. RACF residents who present to ED are more likely to have hospital readmissions, longer stays and face major risks related to hospital acquired complications. Aged Care Emergency services (ACE) is a nurse led, protocol- guided, telephone RACF/ED outreach model that has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalisation and length of hospital stay for RACF residents in the Hunter New England Local Health District, New South Wales (NSW). The Partnerships in Aged-Care Emergency services using Interactive Telehealth (PACE-IT) project enhances ACE by incorporating interactive video assessment and consultation. The PACE-IT project’s primary aim is to assess whether augmentation of ACE services through the addition of protocol-guided interactive Visual Telehealth Consultation (VTC) for clinical decision-making, plus telephone follow-up, reduces RACF resident transfers to ED.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted. The intervention will be delivered sequentially to 8 clusters; each cluster comprises one ED and two RACFs in NSW, Australia.</jats:p>
<jats:p>The 16 RACFs in the study will be selected for order of implementation using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. A 2-step randomisation process will be undertaken, randomising the hospital EDs first and then randomising the RACFs aligned with each hospital.</jats:p>
<jats:p>The PACE-IT intervention comprises: an initial phone call by RACFs to the ACE service in the ED; the ACE service in ED responds with a protocol-guided VTC, a management plan agreed between all participants; an automated consultation summary letter to the General Practitioner and the RACF; a post VTC 24 h follow-up phone call to the RACF.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>
<jats:p>If shown to be effective, the intervention has the potential to improve the clinical care and quality of life for residents. Findings will provide high level evidence that will inform sustainable change and broad translation into practice across NSW.

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Up to 75% of residents from residential aged care facilities (RACF) are transferred to emergency departments (ED) annually to access assessment and care for unplanned or acute health events. Emergency department presentations of RACF residents can be both expensive and risky, and many are unnecessary and preventable. Processes or triage systems to assess residents with a health event, prior to transfer, may reduce unnecessary ED transfer. The Aged Care Emergency (ACE) service is a nurse-led ED outreach service that provides telephone support to RACF nurses regarding residents’ health events. This service is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 4 pm (ED ACE hours). The primary objective of this study was to assess whether the augmentation of the phone-based ED ACE service with the addition of a visual telehealth consultation (VTC) would reduce RACF rate of ED presentations compared to usual care. The secondary objectives were to 1) monitor presentations to ED within 48 h post VTC to detect any adverse events and 2) measure RACF staff perceptions of VTC useability and acceptability.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>This implementation study used a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial design. Study settings were four public hospital EDs and 16 RACFs in two Local Health Districts. Each ED was linked to 4 RACFs with approximately 350 RACF beds, totalling 1435 beds across 16 participating RACFs. Facilities were randomised into eight clusters with each cluster comprising one ED and two RACFs.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>A negative binomial regression demonstrated a 29% post-implementation reduction in the rate of ED presentations (per 100 RACF beds), within ED ACE hours (IRR [95% CI]: 0.71 [0.46, 1. 09]; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.122). A 29% reduction, whilst not statistically significant, is still clinically important and impactful for residents and EDs. A post-hoc logistic regression demonstrated a statistically significant 69% reduction in the probability that an episode of care resulted in an ED presentation within ED ACE hours post-implementation compared to pre-implementation (OR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.11, 0.87]; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.025).</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
<jats:p>Findings have shown the positive impact of augmenting ACE with a VTC. Any reduction of resident presentations to a busy ED is beneficial to healthcare overall, but more so to the individual older person who can recover safely and comfortably in their own RACF.</jats:p>

<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent, mobile health–based intervention, SWAP IT, in reducing the energy contribution of discretionary (ie, less healthy) foods and drinks packed for children to consume at school.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>A type I effectiveness–implementation hybrid cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32 primary schools located across 3 local health districts in New South Wales, Australia, to compare the effects of a 6-month intervention targeting foods packed in children’s lunchboxes with those of a usual care control. Primary schools were eligible if they were not participating in other nutrition studies and used the required school communication app. The Behaviour Change Wheel was used to co-design the multicomponent SWAP IT intervention, which consisted of the following: school lunchbox nutrition guidelines, curriculum lessons, information pushed to parents digitally via an existing school communication app, and additional parent resources to address common barriers to packing healthy lunchboxes. The primary outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary lunchbox foods and drinks packed in lunchboxes, was measured via observation using a validated school food checklist at baseline (May 2019) and at 6-month follow-up (October 2019). Additional secondary outcomes included mean lunchbox energy from discretionary foods consumed, mean total lunchbox energy packed and consumed, mean energy content of core lunchbox foods packed and consumed, and percentage of lunchbox energy from discretionary and core foods, all of which were also measured via observation using a validated school food checklist. Measures of school engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, and lunchbox cost were also collected at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Data were analyzed via hierarchical linear regression models, with controlling for clustering, socioeconomic status, and remoteness.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>A total of 3022 (3022/7212, 41.90%) students consented to participate in the evaluation (mean age 7.8 years; 1487/3022, 49.22% girls). There were significant reductions between the intervention and control groups in the primary trial outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary foods packed in lunchboxes (–117.26 kJ; 95% CI –195.59 to –39.83; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.003). Relative to the control, the intervention also significantly reduced secondary outcomes regarding the mean total lunchbox energy (kilojoules) packed (–88.38 kJ; 95% CI –172.84 to –3.92; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.04) and consumed (–117.17 kJ; 95% CI –233.72 to –0.62; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.05). There was no significant difference between groups in measures of student engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, or cost of foods packed in children’s lunchboxes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The SWAP IT intervention was effective in reducing the energy content of foods packed for and consumed by primary school–aged children at school. Dissemination of the SWAP IT program at a population level has the potential to influence a significant proportion of primary school–aged children, impacting weight status and associated health care costs.</p>

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>‘Physical Activity 4 Everyone’ (PA4E1) was an efficacious multi-component school-based physical activity (PA) program targeting adolescents. PA4E1 has seven PA practices. It is essential to scale-up, evaluate effectiveness and assess implementation of such programs. Therefore, the aim is to assess the impact of implementation support on school practice uptake of the PA4E1 program at 12 and 24 months.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A cluster randomised controlled trial, utilising a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, was conducted in 49 randomly selected disadvantaged Australian Government and Catholic secondary schools. A blinded statistician randomly allocated schools to a usual practice control (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 25) or the PA4E1 program group (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 24), with the latter receiving seven implementation support strategies to support school PA practice uptake of the seven practices retained from the efficacy trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of schools adopting at least four of the seven practices, assessed via telephone surveys with Head Physical Education Teachers and analysed using exact logistic regression modelling. This paper reports the 12-month outcomes.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>Schools were recruited from May to November 2017. At baseline, no schools implemented four of the seven practices. At 12 months significantly more schools in the program group had implemented four of the seven practices (16/24, 66.7%) than the control group (1/25, 4%) (OR = 33.0[4.15–1556.4], <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). The program group implemented on average 3.2 (2.5–3.9) more practices than the control group (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001, mean 3.9 (SD 1.5) vs 0.7 (1.0)). Fidelity and reach of the implementation support intervention were high (both &gt; 80%).</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>Through the application of multiple implementation support strategies, secondary schools were able to overcome commonly known barriers to implement evidence based school PA practices. As such practices have been shown to result in an increase in adolescent PA and improvements in weight status, policy makers and practitioners responsible for advocating PA in schools should consider this implementation approach more broadly when working with schools. Follow-up is required to determine whether practice implementation is sustained.</jats:p>

Data were analyzed via hierarchical linear regression models, with controlling for clustering, socioeconomic status, and remoteness.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>A total of 3022 (3022/7212, 41.90%) students consented to participate in the evaluation (mean age 7.8 years; 1487/3022, 49.22% girls). There were significant reductions between the intervention and control groups in the primary trial outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary foods packed in lunchboxes (–117.26 kJ; 95% CI –195.59 to –39.83; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.003). Relative to the control, the intervention also significantly reduced secondary outcomes regarding the mean total lunchbox energy (kilojoules) packed (–88.38 kJ; 95% CI –172.84 to –3.92; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.04) and consumed (–117.17 kJ; 95% CI –233.72 to –0.62; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.05). There was no significant difference between groups in measures of student engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, or cost of foods packed in children’s lunchboxes.</p>

<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The SWAP IT intervention was effective in reducing the energy content of foods packed for and consumed by primary school–aged children at school. Dissemination of the SWAP IT program at a population level has the potential to influence a significant proportion of primary school–aged children, impacting weight status and associated health care costs.</p>

sutherland2021scale,Scale-up of the Physical Activity 4 Everyone (PA4E1) intervention in secondary schools: 24-month implementation and cost outcomes from a cluster randomised controlled trial,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Physical Activity 4 Everyone (PA4E1) is an evidence-based program effective at increasing adolescent physical activity (PA) and improving weight status. This study aimed to determine a) the effectiveness of an adapted implementation intervention to scale-up PA4E1 at 24-month follow-up, b) fidelity and reach, and c) the cost and cost-effectiveness of the implementation support intervention.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>A cluster randomised controlled trial using a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness design in 49 lower socio-economic secondary schools, randomised to a program (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 24) or control group (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 25). An adapted implementation intervention consisting of seven strategies was developed to support schools to implement PA4E1 over 24-months. The primary outcome was the proportion of schools implementing at least four of the 7 PA practices, assessed via computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with Head Physical Education Teachers. Secondary outcomes included the mean number of PA practices implemented, fidelity and reach, cost and cost-effectiveness. Logistic regression models assessed program effects.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>At baseline, no schools implemented four of the 7 PA practices. At 24-months, significantly more schools in the program group (16/23, 69.6%) implemented at least four of the 7 PA practices than the control group (0/25, 0%) (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). At 24-months, program schools were implementing an average of 3.6 more practices than control schools (4.1 (1.7) vs. 0.5 (0.8), respectively) (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). Fidelity and reach of the implementation intervention were high (&gt; 75%). The total cost of the program was $415,112 AUD (2018) ($17,296 per school; $117.30 per student).</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>The adapted implementation intervention provides policy makers and researchers with an effective and potentially cost-effective model for scaling-up the delivery of PA4E1 in secondary schools. Further assessment of sustainability is warranted.</jats:p>

There was a non-significant increase seen for the affected side of uninfected patients (mean difference = 23 mL/min, p = 0.2). The difference in these effects (34 mL/min) was not statistically significant ( p = 0.3). The mean flow rate decreased in the unaffected side for both infected (−27 mL/min, p = 0.5) and uninfected patients (−69 mL/min, p = 0.01).

timothyregan2017compa,Comparison of Two Sources of Clinical Audit Data to Assess the Delivery of Diabetes Care in Aboriginal Communities,"<jats:p>The objective of this study was to determine the concordance between data extracted from two Clinical Decision Support Systems regarding diabetes testing and monitoring at Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services in Australia. De-identified PenCAT and Communicare Systems data were extracted from the services allocated to the intervention arm of a diabetes care trial, and intra-class correlations for each extracted item were derived at a service level. Strong to very strong correlations between the two data sources were found regarding the total number of patients with diabetes per service (Intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.99), as well as the number (ICC = 0.98–0.99) and proportion (ICC = 0.96) of patients with diabetes by gender. The correlation was moderate for the number and proportion of Type 2 diabetes patients per service in the group aged 18–34 years (ICC = 0.65 and 0.8–0.82 respectively). Strong to very strong correlations were found for numbers and proportions of patients being tested for diabetes, and for appropriate monitoring of patients known to have diabetes (ICC = 0.998–1.00). This indicated a generally high degree of concordance between whole-service data extracted by the two Clinical Decision Support Systems. Therefore, the less expensive or less complex option (depending on the individual circumstances of the service) may be appropriate for monitoring diabetes testing and care. However, the extraction of data about subgroups of patients may not be interchangeable.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Electronic Health Records, Indigenous Health, Intervention Study, Rural Communities."
tracyschumacher2017refer,Reference Intervals for Non-Fasting {CVD} Lipids and Inflammation Markers in Pregnant Indigenous Australian Women,"<jats:p>Indigenous Australians experience high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The origins of CVD may commence during pregnancy, yet few serum reference values for CVD biomarkers exist specific to the pregnancy period. The Gomeroi gaaynggal research project is a program that undertakes research and provides some health services to pregnant Indigenous women. Three hundred and ninety-nine non-fasting samples provided by the study participants (206 pregnancies and 175 women) have been used to construct reference intervals for CVD biomarkers during this critical time. A pragmatic design was used, in that women were not excluded for the presence of chronic or acute health states. Percentile bands for non-linear relationships were constructed according to the methods of Wright and Royston (2008), using the xriml package in StataIC 13.1. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, cystatin-C and alkaline phosphatase increased as gestational age progressed, with little change seen in high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and γ glutamyl transferase. Values provided in the reference intervals are consistent with findings from other research projects. These reference intervals will form a basis with which future CVD biomarkers for pregnant Indigenous Australian women can be compared.</jats:p>","Biomarkers, Cardiovascular Disease, Indigenous Australians, Pregnancy, Reference Intervals"

Methods A cross-sectional analysis from an ongoing cohort study of registrars’ clinical consultations in five Australian states. Registrars recorded detailed data from 60 consecutive consultations per 6-month training term. Problems and diagnoses encountered, including chronic disease classification, were coded using the International Classification of Primary Care, second edition duplication system (ICPC-2plus) classification system. The outcome factor in our analysis was GPN involvement in management of individual problems and diagnoses. Independent variables were a range of patient, registrar, practice, consultation and educational factors. Results We analysed 108759 consultations of 856 registrars including 169307 problems or diagnoses. Of the problems/diagnoses, 5.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.0–5.2) involved a GPN. Follow-up with a GPN was organised for 1.5% (95% CI 1.4–1.5) of all problems/diagnoses. Significant associations of GPN involvement included patient age, male sex, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status, non-English-speaking background (NESB) and the patient being new to the practice. Larger practice size, the particular training organisation, and the problem/diagnosis being new and not a chronic disease were other associations. Conclusions Associations with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status and NESB status suggest GPNs are addressing healthcare needs of these under-serviced groups. But GPNs may be underutilised in chronic disease care. What is known about this topic? GPNs are increasingly involved in team-based care in Australian general practice. The potential positive contribution of GPNs to general practice teams is acknowledged, but the role of the GPN is still being refined. What does this paper add? GPNs contribute to the care of a modest proportion of patients seen by GP registrars. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status and NESB of patients are positively associated with being seen by a GPN; chronic disease is negatively associated with being seen by a GPN. There is geographic variability in prevalence of GPN consultations, not explained by other factors. What are the implications for practitioners? Given the match of GPN skills and attributes to the needs of patients with chronic diseases, GPNs currently may be underutilised in chronic disease care in Australian general practice. The marked geographic variation in uptake of GPNs also suggests scope for greater utilisation of GPNs Australia-wide.</jats:p>","Chronic Kidney Disease, Cross-Sectional Study, Indigenous Health, Observational Study, Rural Communities"

tzelepis2021thel,The Long-Term Effectiveness of Internet-Based Interventions on Multiple Health Risk Behaviors: Systematic Review and Robust Variance Estimation Meta-analysis,"<sec>
<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Smoking tobacco, poor nutrition, risky alcohol use, and physical inactivity (SNAP) behaviors tend to cluster together. Health benefits may be maximized if interventions targeted multiple health risk behaviors together rather than addressing single behaviors. The internet has wide reach and is a sustainable mode for delivery of interventions for multiple health behaviors. However, no systematic reviews have examined the long-term effectiveness of internet-based interventions on any combination of or all SNAP behaviors in adults aged 18 years or older.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>This systematic review examined, among adults (aged ≥18 years), the effectiveness of internet-based interventions on SNAP behaviors collectively in the long term compared with a control condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>The electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched to retrieve studies describing the effectiveness of internet-based interventions on ≥2 SNAP behaviors published by November 18, 2019. The reference lists of retrieved articles were also checked to identify eligible publications. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials or cluster randomized controlled trials with adults examining an internet-based intervention measuring the effect on ≥2 SNAP behaviors at least 6 months postrecruitment and published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Two reviewers independently extracted data from included studies and assessed methodological quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. A robust variance estimation meta-analysis was performed to examine the long-term effectiveness of internet-based interventions on all 4 SNAP risk behavior outcomes. All SNAP outcomes were coded so they were in the same direction, with higher scores equating to worse health risk behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The inclusion criteria were met by 11 studies: 7 studies measured the effect of an internet-based intervention on nutrition and physical activity; 1 study measured the effect on smoking, nutrition, and physical activity; and 3 studies measured the effect on all SNAP behaviors. Compared with the control group, internet-based interventions achieved an overall significant improvement across all SNAP behaviors in the long term (standardized mean difference –0.12 [improvement as higher scores = worse health risk outcomes], 95% CI –0.19 to –0.05; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1.5%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.01). The global methodological quality rating was “moderate” for 1 study, while the remaining 10 studies were rated as “weak.”</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Internet-based interventions were found to produce an overall significant improvement across all SNAP behaviors collectively in the long term. Internet-based interventions targeting multiple SNAP behaviors have the potential to maximize long-term improvements to preventive health outcomes.</p>

<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>
<jats:p>Evidence-based treatment protocols are currently lacking for immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). In this multicentre retrospective study, we examined baseline clinical characteristics and treatment variables that may predict short-term outcomes of patients with IMNM.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>Muscle biopsies from the John Hunter Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital obtained between 2012 and 2019 were reviewed at a single laboratory at South Australia Pathology. All biopsies with histological features of IMNM were identified. Demographics of study subjects, clinical information and myositis-specific antibody status were recorded along with muscle strength, serum creatine kinase (CK) and treatment regimens at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Primary outcome measures were muscle strength and serum CK at 3 and 6 months. Mixed-effects regression models in a Bayesian framework were performed using the R statistical package.</jats:p>

This study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the EATS (Eating Advice to Students) brief (i.e., single use) web-based nutrition intervention for young adult university students. A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 124 students aged 17–35 from the University of Newcastle, Australia. Participants were randomized to EATS (n = 62) or attention control (n = 62). EATS aimed to improve four target eating behaviors (vegetables, fruit, discretionary foods, breakfast). Primary outcomes were feasibility (recruitment, retention, usage, program acceptability). Recruitment and retention numbers were recorded, the program acceptability was assessed by a process evaluation survey and the website usage was objectively tracked. Preliminary efficacy was assessed via changes in diet quality (primary), fruit, vegetables, discretionary foods and breakfast intake, measured using Food Frequency Questionnaire. Recruitment was completed in five weeks. Retention was 73% (90/124) at 3-months. Intervention participants used EATS 1.5 ± 1.0 times. Satisfaction with EATS was rated at 4.04 ± 0.74 (maximum five). Intervention participants significantly decreased the percentage energy/day from discretionary foods compared with control (−4.8%, 95%CI −8.6, −1.1, p = 0.012, d = −0.34). No significant between-group differences were observed for diet quality, fruit, vegetable or breakfast intakes. EATS demonstrated high feasibility, particularly for reach and acceptability.

<jats:p>Fluoropyrimidine (FP) chemotherapies are commonly prescribed for upper and lower gastrointestinal, breast and head and neck malignancies. Over 16,000 people with cancer require FP chemotherapies <jats:italic>per annum</jats:italic> in Australia. Between 10 and 40% patients experience grade 3–4 (≥ G3) toxicities that require hospital-based management ± intensive care admission. Approximately 1% of patients die secondary to FP toxicities. Prospective screening for <jats:italic>DPYD</jats:italic> gene variants (encoding the key enzyme for FP catabolism) can identify patients at risk of ≥ G3 toxicity and allow for dose adjustment prior to first FP exposure.

Schools with a web-based canteen lunch ordering system were randomly assigned to receive either a multistrategy behavioral intervention that included choice architecture strategies embedded in the web-based system (n=9 schools) or the standard web-based ordering system only (n=8 control schools). Automatically collected student purchasing data at baseline (term 2, 2018) and 12 months later (term 2, 2019) were used to assess trial outcomes. Primary trial outcomes included the mean energy (kJ), saturated fat (g), sugar (g), and sodium (mg) content of student lunch orders. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of all web-based lunch order items classified as &lt;i&gt;everyday&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;occasional&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;caution&lt;/i&gt; (based on the New South Wales Healthy School Canteen Strategy) and canteen revenue.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>From baseline to follow-up, the intervention lunch orders had significantly lower energy content (−69.4 kJ, 95% CI −119.6 to −19.1; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.01) and saturated fat content (−0.6 g, 95% CI −0.9 to −0.4; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001) than the control lunch orders, but they did not have significantly lower sugar or sodium content. There was also a small significant between-group difference in the percentage of energy from saturated fat (−0.9%, 95% CI −1.4% to −0.5%; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001) but not in the percentage of energy from sugar (+1.1%, 95% CI 0.2% to 1.9%; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.02). Relative to control schools, intervention schools had significantly greater odds of having &lt;i&gt;everyday&lt;/i&gt; items purchased (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001), corresponding to a 9.8% increase in &lt;i&gt;everyday&lt;/i&gt; items, and lower odds of having &lt;i&gt;occasional&lt;/i&gt; items purchased (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001), corresponding to a 7.7% decrease in &lt;i&gt;occasional&lt;/i&gt; items); however, there was no change in the odds of having &lt;i&gt;caution&lt;/i&gt; (least healthy) items purchased (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-1.0; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=.05). Furthermore, there was no change in schools’ revenue between groups.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Given the evidence of small statistically significant improvements in the energy and saturated fat content, acceptability, and wide reach, this intervention has the potential to influence dietary choices at a population level, and further research is warranted to determine its impact when implemented at scale.</p>

wyse2023effec,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital health intervention to support patients with colorectal cancer prepare for and recover from surgery: study protocol of the RecoverEsupport randomised controlled trial,"<jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>Surgery is the most common treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) and can cause relative long average length of stay (LOS) and high risks of unplanned readmissions and complications. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways can reduce the LOS and postsurgical complications. Digital health interventions provide a flexible and low-cost way of supporting patients to achieve this. This protocol describes a trial aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the RecoverEsupport digital health intervention in decreasing the hospital LOS in patients undergoing CRC surgery.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and analysis</jats:title><jats:p>The two-arm randomised controlled trial will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the RecoverEsupport digital health intervention compared with usual care (control) in patients with CRC. The intervention consists of a website and a series of automatic prompts and alerts to support patients to adhere to the patient-led ERAS recommendations. The primary trial outcome is the length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes include days alive and out of hospital; emergency department presentations; quality of life; patient knowledge and behaviours related to the ERAS recommendations; health service utilisation; and intervention acceptability and use.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Ethics and dissemination</jats:title><jats:p>The trial has been approved by the Hunter New England Research Ethics Committee (2019/ETH00869) and the University of Newcastle Ethics Committee (H-2015-0364). Trial findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. If the intervention is effective, the research team will facilitate its adoption within the Local Health District for widespread adaptation and implementation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Trial registration number</jats:title><jats:p>ACTRN12621001533886.</jats:p></jats:sec>","Colorectal Cancer, Digital Health Interventions, Hospital Length Of Stay, Randomised Controlled Trial, Recovery After Surgery"
wyss2018multi,Multiethnic meta-analysis identifies ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry loci for pulmonary function,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Nearly 100 loci have been identified for pulmonary function, almost exclusively in studies of European ancestry populations. We extend previous research by meta-analyzing genome-wide association studies of 1000 Genomes imputed variants in relation to pulmonary function in a multiethnic population of 90,715 individuals of European (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 60,552), African (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 8429), Asian (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 9959), and Hispanic/Latino (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 11,775) ethnicities. We identify over 50 additional loci at genome-wide significance in ancestry-specific or multiethnic meta-analyses. Using recent fine-mapping methods incorporating functional annotation, gene expression, and differences in linkage disequilibrium between ethnicities, we further shed light on potential causal variants and genes at known and newly identified loci. Several of the novel genes encode proteins with predicted or established drug targets, including <jats:italic>KCNK2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>CDK12</jats:italic>. Our study highlights the utility of multiethnic and integrative genomics approaches to extend existing knowledge of the genetics of lung function and clinical relevance of implicated loci.</jats:p>","Genomic Association Studies, Lung Function, Multiethnic Study"

To improve community health, the production of such reviews should align with burden of disease. This study aims to assess if the volume of research output from systematic reviews proportionally aligns with burden of disease assessed using percentages of mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>A cross-sectional audit of reviews published between January 2012 and August 2013 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) was undertaken. Percentages of mortality and DALYs were obtained from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study. Standardised residual differences (SRD) based on percentages of mortality and DALYs were calculated, where conditions with SRD of more than or less than three were considered overstudied or understudied, respectively.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>1029 reviews from CDSR and 1928 reviews from DARE were examined. There was a significant correlation between percentage DALYs and systematic reviews published in CDSR and DARE databases (CDSR: r=0.68, p=0.001; DARE: r=0.60, p&lt;0.001). There was no significant correlation between percentage mortality and number of systematic reviews published in either database (CDSR: r=0.34, p=0.14; DARE: r=0.22, p=0.34). Relative to percentage of mortality, mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal conditions and other non-communicable diseases were overstudied. Maternal disorders were overstudied relative to percentages of mortality and DALYs in CDSR.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The focus of systematic reviews is moderately correlated with DALYs.
